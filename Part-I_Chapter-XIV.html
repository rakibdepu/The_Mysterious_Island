    <b class="cap">The</b> next day, the 16th of April, Easter Sunday, the
    colonists left the Chimneys at daybreak and proceeded to wash their linen
    and to clean their clothes. The engineer counted on making soap as soon
    as he could procure the basic materials necessary for the saponificaiton,
    soda or potash, fat or oil. The important question of the renewal of the
    wardrobe would also be treated in its proper time and place. In any case,
    their clothes would easily last six more months because they were well
    made and could resist the stress of manual labors. But all would depend
    on the position of the island with respect to inhabited lands. This they
    would determine on this very day if the weather permitted it.

    <p>They proceeded to wash their linen.</p>

<p>
    Now the sun rose on a clear horizon announcing a magnificent day, one of
    those beautiful days of autumn which are the final farewells to the warm
    season.
</p>
<p>
    They therefore proceeded to complete the observations of the previous day
    by measuring the height of Grand View Plateau above sea level.
</p>
<p>
    “Will you need an instrument like the one that you used yesterday?”
    Herbert asked the engineer.
</p>
<p>
    “No, my child,” he answered, “we will proceed differently but in a manner
    almost as precise.”
</p>
<p>
    Herbert, loving instruction in all things, followed the engineer, who
    turned away from the foot of the granite wall and went down to the edge
    of the beach. During this time Pencroff, Neb and the reporter were
    occupied with various activities.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith had provided himself with a sort of straight pole, twelve
    feet long, which he had measured as accurately as possible by comparing
    it with his own height which he knew to the nearest inch. Herbert carried
    a plumb line that Cyrus Smith had given him, that is to say a simple
    stone fixed to the end of a flexible fiber.
</p>
<p>
    Arriving about twenty feet from the edge of the shore and about five
    hundred from the granite wall which rose perpendicularly, Cyrus Smith
    drove the pole two feet into the sand and, wedging it in with care, he
    succeeded, by means of the plumb line, in placing it perpendicular to the
    plane of the horizon.
</p>
<p>
    That done he backed up a distance such that when he lay down on the sand,
    the visual ray from his eye simultaneously skimmed the top of the pole
    and the top of the wall. Then he carefully marked this point with a
    thorn.
</p>
<pic>
    <img alt="When he lay down on the sand..." src="images/177.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>When he lay down on the sand...</p>

<p>
    Then, addressing Herbert:
</p>
<p>
    “Do you know the elementary principles of geometry?” he asked him.
</p>
<p>
    “A little, Mister Cyrus,” replied Herbert, who did not wish to stick his
    neck out.
</p>
<p>
    “Do you recall what are the properties of two similar triangles?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes,” replied Herbert. “Their homologous sides are proportional.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, my child, I have constructed two similar right triangles. The
    first, the smaller one, has for its sides the perpendicular pole, the
    distance which separates the thorn from the base of the pole, and my
    visual ray for a hypotenuse; the second has for sides the perpendicular
    wall, whose height we are measuring, the distance that separates the
    thorn from the base of this wall, and my visual ray also forming its
    hypotenuse which is the prolongation of the hypotenuse of the first
    triangle.”
</p>
<p>
    “Ah, Mister Cyrus, I understand” cried Herbert. “The distance from the
    thorn to the pole divided by the distance from the thorn to the base of
    the wall is equal to the height of the pole divided by the height of this
    wall.”
</p>
<p>
    “They are equal, Herbert,” replied the engineer, “and when we have
    measured the first two distances, and since we know the height of the
    pole, we will only have a calculation to make of the ratio, which will
    give us the height of the wall and will save us the trouble of measuring
    it directly.”
</p>
<p>
    The two horizontal distances were determined by means of the pole, whose
    length above the sand was exactly ten feet.
</p>
<p>
    The first distance was fifteen feet between the thorn and the point where
    the pole had been driven into the sand. The second distance, between the
    thorn and the base of the wall, was five hundred feet.
</p>
<p>
    These measurements completed, Cyrus Smith and the lad returned to the
    Chimneys.
</p>
<p>
    There the engineer took a stone plate which he had brought back from his
    previous excursions, a sort of shale slate, on which it was easy to trace
    some numbers by means of a sharp quill. He therefore established the
    following proportion:
</p>
<pre>

                    15 : 500 : : 10 : <i>x</i>

                      500 × 10 = 5000

                    5000
                    ----  = 333.33.
                     15
</pre>
<p>
    From this it was established that the height of the granite wall measured
    three hundred thirty three feet.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith then took the instrument which he had made the previous
    evening and whose two slats, by their separation, gave him the angular
    distance of the star Alpha above the horizon. He very accurately measured
    this angle against a circumference that he had divided into three hundred
    sixty equal parts. Now this angle was 10°. Consequently the total angular
    distance between the pole and the horizon, adding the 27° between Alpha
    and the antarctic pole and reducing it by the height above sea level of
    the plateau on which the observation was made, gave 37°. Cyrus Smith
    therefore concluded that Lincoln Island was situated on the 37th degree
    south latitude, or, taking an error of 5° into account in view of the
    imperfection of these operations, that it was situated between the 35th
    and the 40th parallel.
</p>
<p>
    It remained to obtain the longitude in order to completely determine the
    coordinates of the island. This the engineer would attempt to determine
    this very day at noon, that is to say at the moment when the sun passed
    the meridian.
</p>
<p>
    It was decided that they would take a walk this Sunday or rather an
    exploration of that part of the island situated between the north of the
    lake and Shark’s Gulf, and if the weather permitted, they would continue
    this reconnaissance up to the northern side of South Mandible Cape. They
    would eat on the dunes and only return by evening.
</p>
<p>
    At eight thirty in the morning the small troop followed the border of the
    channel. On the opposite shore, on Safety Island, numerous birds
    promenaded gravely. They were the diving birds of the penguin species,
    very recognizable by their disagreeable cry which brings to mind the
    braying of the donkey. Pencroff could only consider them from the eating
    point of view and learned with a certain satisfaction that their flesh,
    though blackish, was very edible.
</p>
<p>
    They could also see large amphibians crawling on the sand, seals no
    doubt, who seemed to have chosen the islet for refuge. It was hardly
    possible to consider these animals from the alimentary point of view
    because their oily flesh is detestable; however, Cyrus Smith observed
    them carefully and, without making his plans known, announced to his
    companions that they would soon pay a visit to the islet.
</p>
<p>
    The shoreline followed by the colonists was scattered with innumerable
    shellfish some of which would have given joy to an amateur of malacology.
    There were among others phasianella, terebratula, trigonia, etc. But what
    would be very useful was this vast oyster bed discovered by Neb among the
    rocks at low tide, located about four miles from the Chimneys.
</p>
<p>
    “Neb will not have wasted his day,” shouted Pencroff, observing the bank
    of ostracodes which spread out to the open sea.
</p>
<p>
    “In fact it is a fortunate discovery,” said the reporter, “and if, as is
    claimed, each oyster produces fifty to sixty thousand eggs per annum, we
    will have an inexhaustible reserve.”
</p>
<p>
    “Only I believe the oyster is not very nourishing,” said Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    “No,” replied Cyrus Smith. “The oyster contains very little protein and
    if a man ate them exclusively he would need no less than fifteen to
    sixteen dozen each day.”
</p>
<p>
    “Good,” said Pencroff. “We could devour dozens upon dozens before
    exhausting the bank. Shall we take some for our lunch?”
</p>
<p>
    And without waiting for a reply to his proposition, knowing full well
    that it would be approved in advance, the sailor and Neb detached a
    certain quantity of these mollusks. They placed them in a sort of
    hibiscus fiber net that Neb had made and which already contained the
    meal’s menu; then they continued to ascend the shore between the dunes
    and the sea.
</p>
<p>
    From time to time Cyrus Smith consulted his watch in order to prepare for
    the moment when the solar observation would take place, which had to be
    at noon precisely.
</p>
<p>
    All of this portion of the island was very arid up to the point which
    closed Union Bay and which had received the name of South Mandible Cape.
    They saw there only sand and shells mixed with the debris of lava.
    Several sea birds frequented this desolated coast, sea gulls, large
    albatrosses as well as wild duck who with good reason excited Pencroff’s
    covetousness. He tried to attack them with arrows but without result
    because they hardly remained still and he could not reach them in flight.
</p>
<p>
    This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer:
</p>
<p>
    “You can see, Mister Cyrus, that unless we have one or two fowling
    pieces, our equipment will leave much to be desired.”
</p>
<p>
    “Doubtless, Pencroff,” replied the reporter, “but it depends only on you.
    Get us iron for the barrel, steel for the firing pins, saltpeter, carbon
    and sulphur for the powder, mercury and nitric acid for the detonater,
    and finally lead for the balls and Cyrus will make us guns of the highest
    quality.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh!” replied the engineer, “without doubt we could find all these
    substances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument which
    requires tools of high precision. However we will see later on.”
</p>
<p>
    “Why,” cried Pencroff, “did we throw overboard all the weapons that the
    basket carried, and our utensils, even our pocket knives?”
</p>
<p>
    “But if we hadn’t thrown them out, Pencroff, it would be us that the
    balloon would have thrown to the bottom of the sea,” said Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    “What you say is true, my boy,” replied the sailor.
</p>
<p>
    Then passing to another thought:
</p>
<p>
    “But think,” he added, “what must have been the bewilderment of Jonathan
    Forster and his companions when the next morning they found the square
    empty and the machine flown away.”
</p>
<p>
    “My last care is to know what they thought,” said the reporter.
</p>
<p>
    “Nevertheless, it was I who thought of the idea,” said Pencroff, with a
    pleased look.
</p>
<p>
    “A good idea, Pencroff,” replied Gideon Spilett laughing, “and one which
    has placed us where we are.”
</p>
<p>
    “I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,” cried the
    sailor, “especially since Mister Smith has been kind enough to come and
    join us.”
</p>
<p>
    “And I also, truly.” replied the reporter. “Besides, what do we lack?
    Nothing!”
</p>
<p>
    “If that is not... everything.” answered Pencroff, who roared with
    laughter, shaking his large shoulders, “but one day or another we will
    find the means to leave.”
</p>
<p>
    “And perhaps sooner than you imagine, my friends,” the engineer then
    said, “if Lincoln Island is only a moderate distance from an inhabited
    archipelago or a continent. In an hour we will know. I do not have a map
    of the Pacific but I have a very clear memory of its southern portion.
    The latitude which I obtained yesterday placed Lincoln Island between New
    Zealand on the west and the coast of Chile on the east. But between these
    two lands the distance is at least six thousand miles. It thus remains to
    determine which point the island occupies on this large space of ocean
    and it is that which the longitude will give us within the hour with a
    sufficient approximation, I hope.”
</p>
<p>
    “Isn’t the archipelago of Tuamotu the nearest to us in latitude?” asked
    Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes,” replied the engineer, “but the distance which separates us from it
    is more than twelve hundred miles.”
</p>
<p>
    “And that way?” said Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme
    interest, his hand pointing south.
</p>
<p>
    “There, nothing,” replied Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    “Nothing, in fact,” added the engineer.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, Cyrus,” asked the reporter, “if Lincoln Island is only two or
    three hunderd miles from New Zealand or from Chile?...”
</p>
<p>
    “Well,” replied the engineer, “instead of making a house we will make a
    boat and Master Pencroff will be in charge of maneuvering it...”
</p>
<p>
    “To be sure, Mister Cyrus,” cried the sailor, “I am all ready to be
    captain... as soon as you will find the means to construct a vessel large
    enough to take to sea.”
</p>
<p>
    “We will make it, if that is necessary,” replied Cyrus Smith.
</p>
<p>
    But while these men, who truly doubted nothing, were chatting, the hour
    approached during which the observation would take place. How would Cyrus
    Smith verify the passage of the sun on the meridian of the island without
    any instrument? Herbert could not guess.
</p>
<p>
    The observers then found themselves at a distance of six miles from the
    Chimneys, not far from that part of the dunes in which the engineer had
    been found after his puzzling rescue. They halted in this locality and
    everyone got ready to eat since it was eleven thirty. Herbert went to get
    some sweet water from a stream which flowed nearby and he carried it in a
    jug provided by Neb.
</p>
<p>
    During these preparations Cyrus Smith arranged everything for his
    astronomical observation. He chose a very flat place on the beach that
    the receding sea had perfectly leveled. This very fine bed of sand was
    made as smooth as glass without any grain of sand higher than another.
    However it was of little importance whether this bed was horizontal or
    not and of no importance that the six foot rod be placed perpendicularly.
    To the contrary, the engineer even inclined it to the south that is to
    say to the side opposite the sun, because it should not be forgotten that
    since Lincoln Island was situated in the southern hemisphere, the
    colonists saw the radiant orb describe its diurnal arc above the northern
    horizon and not the southern horizon.
</p>
<p>
    Herbert then understood how the engineer was going to proceed to
    determine the sun’s highest point, that is to say its passage on the
    meridian of the island or in other terms, the local noontime. It was by
    means of the shadow projected on the sand by the rod, the means which, in
    the absence of an instrument, would give him an approximation sufficient
    for the result he wished to obtain.
</p>
<p>
    In fact the moment when this shadow would attain its minimum length would
    be precisely noon and it would suffice to follow the end of this shadow
    in order to recognize the instant when, after having successively
    diminished it would begin to lengthen. By inclining the rod to the side
    opposite to the sun, Cyrus Smith produced a longer shadow and
    consequently his modification would make his determination easier. In
    fact, the larger the pointer of a dial is, the easier it is to follow the
    displacement of its point. The shadow of the rod was nothing more than
    the pointer of a dial.
</p>
<p>
    When he thought that the moment had arrived, Cyrus Smith knelt on the
    sand and by means of small wooden pegs that he stuck into the sand, he
    began to check off the successive decreases in the shadow of the rod. His
    companions, leaning over him, followed the operation with extreme
    interest.
</p>
<p>
    The reporter held his chronometer in his hand ready to note the time when
    the shadow would be its shortest. Inasmuch as Cyrus Smith was operating
    on the 16th of April, a day in which the true time and the average time
    coincide, the time given by Gideon Spilett would be the true time then at
    Washington, which would simplify the calculation.
</p>
<p>
    The sun advanced slowly; the shadow of the rod diminished little by
    little and when it seemed to Cyrus Smith that it began to lengthen:
</p>
<pic>
    <img alt="The sun advanced slowly." src="images/186.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>The sun advanced slowly.</p>
</pic>
<p>
    “What time is it?” he said.
</p>
<p>
    “Five o’clock and one minute," Gideon Spilett replied at once.
</p>
<p>
    It remained only to make the calculation. Nothing was easier. There was,
    as they saw, in round figures, a difference of five hours between the
    meridian of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is to say, it was
    noontime on Lincoln Island when it was already five o’clock in the
    evening in Washington. Now the sun, in its apparent movement around the
    earth, covers one degree in four minutes making 15° per hour. 15°
    multiplied by five hours gives 75°.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore since Washington is at 77° 3′ 11″ say 77° counting from the
    meridian of Greenwich—which the Americans take as the longitude reference
    concurrently with the English—it follows that the island was situated at
    77° plus 75° to the west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say at
    the 152nd degree west longitude.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith announced this result to his companions and taking account of
    the errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he could
    affirm that the coordinates of Lincoln Island were between the 35th and
    40th parallel and between the 150th and the 155th meridians to the west
    of the meridian of Greenwich.
</p>
<p>
    The possible variations that he attributed to observational errors were,
    as we saw, 5° both ways which, at sixty miles per degree, gave an error
    of three hundred miles in latitude or in longitude for the exact
    location.
</p>
<p>
    But this error would have no influence on the decision they would have to
    make. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a distance from
    all land or archipelagos that they could not hazard to cross this
    distance in a simple and fragile boat.
</p>
<p>
    In fact this determination placed it at least twelve hundred miles from
    Tahiti and the islands of the archipelago of Tuamotu, more than eighteen
    hundred miles from New Zealand and more than four thousand five hundred
    miles from the American coast.
</p>
<p>
    And when Cyrus Smith consulted his memory he could not recall in any
    fashion that an island occupied that part of the Pacific assigned to
    Lincoln Island.
