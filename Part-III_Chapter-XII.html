    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">The</b> next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the
      exploration of all of the wooded part which formed the shore from Reptile
      Promontory to Falls River. The colonists could investigate deep into this
      forest because, extending between the two shores of Serpentine Peninsula,
      its width was only three to four miles. The trees, by their height and
      their thick branches, attested to the fertility of the soil which was
      more astonishing here than on any other portion of the island. It was
      like a corner of the virgin forests of America or of central Africa
      transported to this temperate zone. They were led to the conclusion that
      these superb plants found in this soil a moisture in the upper level but
      heat at the interior due to volcanic fires, a warmth which did not belong
      to the temperate climate. The dominant species were these kauris and
      these eucalyptuses which took on gigantic dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the goal of the colonists was not to admire these magnificent plants.
      They already knew that, in this connection, Lincoln Island deserved to
      rank with the Canaries group which was first called Fortune Islands. Now
      alas, their island no longer belonged to them completely; others had
      taken possession of it, criminals who trampled everything underfoot and
      they must destroy them to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      However carefully they looked, they found no more traces on the western
      coast. No more footprints, no more cuts on the trees, no more cold
      cinders, no more abandoned camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This does not astonish me,” said Cyrus Smith to his companions. “The
      convicts landed on the island near Flotsom Point and they immediately
      dashed into the forests of the Far West after having crossed the Tadorn
      marshes. They then very nearly followed the route that we had taken on
      leaving Granite House. This explains the traces that we recognized in the
      woods. But on arriving on the coastline, the convicts realized that they
      would find no suitable retreat there and it was then that, after having
      ascended northward, they discovered the corral...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where they have perhaps returned...” said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not think so,” replied the engineer, “because they must have
      assumed that our search would carry us in that direction. The corral is
      only a storehouse for them and not a fixed camp.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I agree with Cyrus,” said the reporter, “and in my opinion it is among
      the buttresses of Mount Franklin that the convicts have found a retreat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, Mister Cyrus, straight to the corral!” shouted Pencroff. “We must
      finish the job and up until now we’ve been wasting our time!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my friend,” replied the engineer, “you forget that we had an
      interest in knowing if the forests of the Far West concealed some
      dwelling. Our exploration has a double purpose, Pencroff. If on the one
      hand we must punish a crime, on the other hand we owe a debt of
      gratitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor. “Nevertheless, it is
      my opinion that we will find this gentleman only when he wishes it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And really Pencroff was only expressing everyone’s opinion. It was likely
      that the stranger’s retreat was no less mysterious than was he himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. Sleeping
      arrangements followed their custom and they took the usual precautions
      for the night. Herbert again became the vigorous youth that he had been
      before his illness, profiting largely from this existence in the open air
      between the breezes from the ocean and the vivifying atmosphere of the
      forests. His place was no longer in the cart but at the head of the
      caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists abandoned the shore
      where, beyond the mouth, the basalts of all shapes were so picturesquely
      piled up, and ascended the left bank of the watercourse. The route had
      been partly cleared during previous excursions from the corral to the
      west coast. The colonists then found themselves at a distance of six
      miles from Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer’s plan was as follows: to carefully examine the entire
      valley whose bottom formed the bed of the river, and to cautiously reach
      the neighborhood of the corral; if the corral was occupied, to take it by
      force; if it was not, to entrench themselves there and make it the center
      of operations with the object of exploring Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists and truly they were
      longing to regain complete possession of their island.
    </p>
    <p>
      They travelled along the narrow valley which separated the two most
      powerful buttresses of Mount Franklin. The trees, pressed together on the
      banks of the river, became rarer toward the upper zones of the volcano.
      It was uneven hilly ground, very suitable for ambushes, over which they
      moved with care. Top and Jup marched as guides and dashing to the right
      and to the left into the thick brushwood, they competed with intelligence
      and with skill. But there was nothing to indicate that the banks of the
      watercourse had been recently frequented, nothing to announce either the
      presence or the proximity of the convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      About five o’clock in the evening the cart stopped about six hundred feet
      from the palisaded enclosure. A semicircular curtain of large trees still
      concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must now reconnoiter the corral in order to know if it was occupied.
      To go there openly in full daylight, with the convicts very likely in
      ambush, would be to invite some foul play as had struck Herbert. It would
      be better to wait for night to come on.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Gideon Spilett wanted, without further delay, to reconnoiter the
      approaches to the corral and Pencroff, at the end of his patience,
      offered to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my friends,” replied the engineer. “Wait for night. I will not allow
      any of you to expose yourself in full daylight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, Mister Cyrus...” replied the sailor, barely disposed to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg you, Pencroff,” said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So be it!” replied the sailor, who vented his anger at the convicts with
      the roughest language of his maritime repertoire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists thus remained near the cart and carefully surveyed the
      neighboring parts of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours passed. The wind died out and an absolute silence reigned
      under the large trees. The breaking of a twig, the noise of footsteps on
      the dry leaves or any movement through the grass would have been heard
      without difficulty. Everything was quiet. Besides, Top, lying on the
      ground with his head resting on his paws, gave no sign of concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o’clock, the evening had advanced so that the reconnaissance
      could be made under good conditions. Gideon Spilett was ready to leave
      accompanied by Pencroff. Cyrus Smith gave his consent. Top and Jup would
      remain with the engineer, Herbert and Neb because any bark or cry uttered
      at an inappropriate time would give the alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not get involved in any imprudence,” Cyrus Smith advised the sailor
      and the reporter. “You are not to take possession of the corral but only
      to discover if it is occupied or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is agreed,” replied Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they both left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over a radius of thirty to forty feet, the darkness already rendered
      objects invisible thanks to the thick foliage of the trees. The reporter
      and Pencroff, stopping for any noise that aroused their suspicion,
      advanced very carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked at a distance from each other in order to offer less of a
      prize to any gunfire. And, as a matter of fact, they expected a gunshot
      at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after they left the cart, Gideon Spilett and Pencroff
      reached the edge of the woods at the clearing in front of the palisaded
      enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped. Dim light still bathed the prairie, devoid of trees. The
      door of the corral, thirty feet away, seemed to be closed. These thirty
      feet to be crossed between the edge of the woods and the enclosure
      constituted the danger zone, to use an expression borrowed from
      ballistics. In fact, one or more bullets fired from the top of the
      palisade would throw to the ground anyone who ventured into this zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett and the sailor were not men to recoil but they knew that
      any imprudence on their part, in which they would be the first victims,
      would affect their companions. With themselves killed, what would become
      of Cyrus Smith, Neb and Herbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pencroff, overexcited by feeling himself so near the corral where he
      supposed that the convicts had found refuge, was going to move forward
      when the reporter held him back with a firm hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In a few minutes it will be completely dark,” murmured Gideon Spilett
      into Pencroff’s ear, “and that will be the moment to act.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/741.jpg" border="1" width="325" height="460" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b>“In a few minutes,” murmured Gideon Spilett...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Pencroff convulsively squeezed the butt of his gun, restraining himself,
      waiting and fuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the last glimmer of twilight was completely gone. The darkness
      seemed to leave the thick forest and envelope the clearing. Mount
      Franklin rose like an enormous screen in front of the western horizon,
      and darkness came on rapidly as it does in regions of lower latitude.
      This was the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment that they had posted themselves at the edge of the woods,
      the reporter and Pencroff had not lost sight of the palisaded enclosure.
      The corral seemed to be absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade
      formed a line a little darker than the surrounding environment and
      nothing impaired its distinctness. However, if the convicts were there,
      one of them would be posted to guard against any surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett seized the hand of his companion and they both advanced,
      crawling toward the corral with their guns ready to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the door of the enclosure without a single ray to light up
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff tried to push the door open, which the reporter and he supposed
      was closed. However the sailor was able to determine that the exterior
      bars were not in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could therefore conclude that the convicts were occupying the corral
      and that they had really fastened the door so that it could not be
      forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett and Pencroff listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no noise from inside the enclosure. The sheep and the goats,
      doubtless sleeping in their stables, did not disturb the calm of the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter and the sailor, hearing nothing, asked themselves if they
      should climb the palisade and get into the corral. That would be contrary
      to Cyrus Smith’s instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true that the operation could succeed but it could also miscarry.
      Now if the convicts suspected nothing, if they had no knowledge of the
      expedition undertaken against them, if in short there existed at this
      moment a chance to surprise them, should they jeopardize this chance by
      thoughtlessly going over the palisade?
    </p>
    <p>
      That was not the reporter’s opinion. He felt that it was best to wait
      until the colonists were all together before attempting to get into the
      corral. This much was certain, that they could come right up to the
      palisade without being seen and that the enclosure did not appear to be
      guarded. This point settled it remained only to return to the cart which
      they ventured to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff probably agreed with this way of looking at things because he
      had no difficulty in following the reporter when the latter retreated to
      the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later the engineer was brought up to date with the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” he said after some thought, “I now have reason to believe that
      the convicts are not at the corral.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will surely know that,” replied Pencroff, “when we have scaled the
      enclosure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the corral, my friends!” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we leave the cart in the woods?” asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the engineer, “it is our ammunition and supply wagon and if
      need be it will serve as an entrenchment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forward then,” said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart left the woods and began to roll without noise toward the
      palisade. It was just as dark and quiet as when Pencroff and the reporter
      had been crawling on the ground. The thick grass completely muffled the
      noise of their footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were ready to fire. On Pencroff’s order, Jup stayed behind.
      Neb held Top in leash so that he would not rush forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the clearing appeared. It was deserted. Without hesitating, the
      small troop went toward the enclosure. In a short space of time the
      danger zone was crossed. No shot had been fired. When the cart reached
      the palisade, it stopped. Neb was at the head of the onagers to hold them
      back. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert and Pencroff then went to the
      door in order to see if it was barricaded from the inside...
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the doors was open!
    </p>
    <p>
      “What were you saying,?” the engineer asked, turning toward the sailor
      and Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Upon my salvation,” said Pencroff, “this door was closed just now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists then hesitated. Had the convicts been in the corral when
      Pencroff and the reporter had made their reconnaissance? That could not
      be doubted since the door, closed at the time, could only have been
      opened by them. Were they still there or had one of them gone out?
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these questions were instantly on everyone’s mind but what should
      they do?
    </p>
    <p>
      At his moment Herbert, who had advanced a few feet into the enclosure,
      rushed out and seized Cyrus Smith’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?” asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A light!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the house?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
      All five advanced toward the door and in fact, through the panes of the
      window which faced them, they saw a feeble flickering light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith quickly made his decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a unique chance,” he said to his companions, “to find the convicts
      in the house expecting nothing. They are ours! Forward!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists moved quietly inside the enclosure, with weapons ready to
      fire. The cart had been left outside, guarded by Jup and by Top, who had
      been prudently tied to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith, Pencroff and Gideon Spilett on the one side and Herbert and
      Neb on the other, ran along the palisade, observing that this part of the
      corral was absolutely dark and deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes all were at the house, in front of the door which was
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith signaled to his companions to hold back while he approached
      the window pane then feebly lit by an inside light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked into the only room which formed the ground floor of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table was a lighted lamp. Near the table was the bed formerly used
      by Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bed lay the body of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Cyrus Smith drew back and in a stifling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton!” he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the door was forced rather than opened and the colonists
      rushed into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton seemed to be sleeping. His appearance showed that he had suffered
      long and cruelly. They saw large bruises on his wrists and ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith leaned over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton!” shouted the engineer, seizing the arms of him whom they had
      found again under such unexpected circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing his name, Ayrton opened his eyes, looked at Cyrus Smith and
      then at the others:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You,” he shouted, “you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton! Ayrton!” repeated Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where am I?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the house at the corral!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alone?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But they are coming!” shouted Ayrton. “Defend yourself! Defend
      yourself!”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/746.jpg" border="1" width="325" height="460" alt=

        <b>“But they are coming!” shouted Ayrton.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And Ayrton fell back exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Spilett,” the engineer then said, “we may be attacked at any moment.
      Bring the cart into the corral. Then barricade the door and come back
      here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff, Neb and the reporter hastened to carry out the engineer’s
      orders. There was not a moment to lose. Perhaps the cart itself was
      already in the hands of the convicts!
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the reporter and his two companions crossed the corral and
      reached the door of the palisade behind which they heard Top growling
      dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, leaving Ayrton for a moment, left the house, ready to fire.
      Herbert was at his side. They both surveyed the top of the buttress which
      overlooked the corral. If the convicts were in ambush there they could
      kill the colonists one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of
      the forest, and a white sheet of light spread out over the interior of
      the enclosure. The corral was fully illuminated, with its cluster of
      trees, the small stream which watered it and its wide carpet of grass.
      The house and a part of the palisade stood out in white against the side
      of the mountain. On the opposite side, toward the door, the enclosure
      remained dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      A black mass soon appeared. It was the cart which entered the circle of
      light and Cyrus Smith could hear the noise of the door which his
      companions had closed again by firmly fastening the bars on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that moment, Top broke his leach, barked furiously and rushed
      toward the back of the corral to the right of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “On guard, my friends, and take aim...,” shouted Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists put their guns to their shoulders and waited for the moment
      to fire. Top barked without letup and Jup ran after the dog, making sharp
      hisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists followed him and reached the small stream which was
      overshadowed by large trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, in full light, what did they see?
    </p>
    <p>
      Five bodies lying on the bank!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

    <p>
      They were those of the convicts who four months earlier had set foot on
      Lincoln Island.
