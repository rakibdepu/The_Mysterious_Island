<p class="huge">
    <b class="cap">The</b> next day, the 22nd of May, they began working on
    the special arrangements for the new dwelling. In fact, the exchange of
    their insufficient shelter at the Chimneys for this vast and sound
    retreat cut into solid rock and sheltered from the waters of sea and sky,
    was long overdue. The Chimneys, however, would not be entirely abandoned
    and it was the engineer’s plan to make it into a workshop for heavier
    work.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith’s first concern was to discover the precise position of
    Granite House from the outside. He went to the beach, to the foot of the
    enormous wall and, as the pick on escaping from the reporter’s hands had
    to fall perpendicularly, it sufficed to recover the pick in order to
    discover the place where the hole had been pierced in the granite.
</p>
<p>
    The pick was easily found and in fact there was an opening about eighty
    feet perpendicularly above the point on the shore where it had been
    driven into the sand. Some rock pigeons were already entering and leaving
    by this narrow opening. It really seemed that Granite House was
    discovered just for them.
</p>
<p>
    It was the engineer’s intention to divide the right side of the cavern
    into several rooms, preceded by an entrance corridor, and to light it by
    means of five windows and a door pierced in the facade. Pencroff readily
    admitted the need for five windows but he could not understand the need
    for the door since the old passageway offered a natural staircase by
    which it would always be easy to have access into Granite House.
</p>
<p>
    “My friend,” Cyrus Smith replied to him, “if it will be easy for us to
    reach our dwelling by the passageway, it will be equally easy for others
    to do so. I intend, on the contrary, to obstruct the passageway at its
    opening, to seal it hermetically and, if necessary, to completely conceal
    the entrance by raising the water of the lake with a dam.”
</p>
<p>
    “And how will we enter?” asked the sailor.
</p>
<p>
    “By an outside ladder,” replied Cyrus Smith, “a cord ladder, which once
    drawn up will render access to our dwelling impossible.”
</p>
<p>
    “But why so many precautions?” said Pencroff. “So far, the animals don’t
    seem to be very formidable. As to natives, the island has none.”
</p>
<p>
    “Are you sure of it, Pencroff?” asked the engineer, looking at the
    sailor.
</p>
<p>
    “We will evidently be sure of it when we have explored all its parts,”
    replied Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes,” said Cyrus Smith, “we still know only a small portion of it. But
    in any case, if we have no enemies from within, they can come from
    outside because these parts of the Pacific are dangerous parts. Let us
    therefore take precautions against all eventualities.”
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith spoke wisely and without making any further objection
    Pencroff prepared to execute his orders.
</p>
<p>
    The front of Granite House would thus be lighted by means of five windows
    and a door to serve what constituted “the apartment” properly called. A
    large bay window and a “bull’s eye” window would permit light to enter
    profusely into this marvellous nave which would serve as a large hall.
    This front, at eighty feet above the ground, was exposed to the east and
    the rising sun greeted it with its first rays. It was situated on that
    portion of the facade between the salient forming corner at the mouth of
    the Mercy and a line drawn perpendicularly above the pile of rocks which
    formed the Chimneys. Thus the strong winds, that is to say those from the
    northeast, would only strike it aslant because it was protected by the
    orientation of the salient. However, until the window frames were made,
    the engineer intended to close the openings with thick shutters which
    would allow neither the wind nor the rain to pass through and which could
    be concealed if need be.
</p>
<p>
    The first job consisted of hollowing out these openings. Using a pick on
    this hard rock would have been very slow and it is known that Cyrus Smith
    was a man of spectacular methods. He still had a certain quantity of
    nitroglycerin and he put it to good use. The effect of the explosive was
    properly localized and under its force the granite was broken at the very
    places chosen by the engineer. Then the pick and the pickaxe completed
    the ogival design of the five windows, the spacious bay window, the
    bull’s eye window and the door. They straightened out the frames, whose
    profiles were rather capricious and, several days after the beginning of
    these works, Granite House was generously lighted by the light of the
    rising sun which penetrated its most secret recesses.
</p>
<p>
    Following the plan devised by Cyrus Smith, the apartment would be divided
    into five compartments having a view of the sea. To the right, an
    entrance served by a door to which the ladder was attached, then a main
    kitchen thirty feet wide, a dining room measuring forty feet, a dormitory
    of equal size, and finally a “guest room”, called for by Pencroff, which
    was at the edge of the Grand Hall.
</p>
<p>
    These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms which formed the apartment of
    Granite House, would not occupy all the space of the cavern. There would
    be a central corridor and a large storehouse into which utensils,
    provisions and reserves would easily find a place. All the products
    gathered on the island, the flora as well as the fauna, would be there in
    an excellent condition of conservation, and completely sheltered from the
    dampness. There was no lack of space and each item would be placed
    methodically. Beyond that, the colonists still had the small grotto
    situated above the large cavern, which would be like the garret of the
    new dwelling.
</p>
<p>
    This plan decided on, it remained only to put it into execution. The
    miners became bricklayers once again. The bricks were carried and placed
    at the foot of Granite House.
</p>
<p>
    Until then Cyrus Smith and his companions had access to the cavern only
    through the old passageway. This mode of communication obliged them first
    to climb to Grand View Plateau after making a detour at the bank of the
    river, to descend two hundred feet by the corridor and then to climb up
    again when they wanted to return to the plateau. That way time was lost
    with considerable fatigue. Cyrus Smith hence resolved without delay to
    make a sturdy cord ladder which, once drawn up, would render the entrance
    to Granite House completely inaccessible.
</p>
<p>
    This ladder was made with extreme care. Its sides, which were formed of
    juncus fibers and woven with a wheel, had the strength of a thick cable.
    As to its rungs, they were made of the light but tough branches of the
    red cedar. The apparatus was made by the master hand of Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    Other cords were made with vegetable fibers in the same way and a sort of
    large pulleyblock was installed at the door. In this way the bricks could
    be easily lifted to the level of Granite House. The transport of material
    was very simplified and the interior arrangements, properly called, soon
    began. There was no lack of lime and several thousand bricks were there,
    ready to be used. They easily set up the woodwork of the partitions, in a
    very rudimentary way of course, and in a very short time the apartment
    was divided into rooms and into a storehouse according to the plan agreed
    upon.
</p>
<p>
    These various works proceeded rapidly under the direction of the
    engineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No manual
    activity was a stranger to Cyrus Smith, who thereby gave an example to
    his intelligent and zealous companions. They worked with confidence, even
    merrily, Pencroff always with a funny word, sometimes as a carpenter,
    sometimes as a rope maker, sometimes mason, and communicating his good
    humor to all of this small colony. His faith in the engineer was
    absolute. Nothing could shake it. He believed him capable of undertaking
    everything and succeeding at everything. The question of clothing and
    shoes—assuredly a serious question—that of light during the winter
    nights, the exploitation of the fertile portions of the island, the
    transformation of this wild vegetation into cultivated vegetation,
    everything seemed easy to him, Cyrus Smith helping, and everything would
    be done in its time. He daydreamt of canals to facilitate the transport
    of the soil’s riches, of exploiting quarries and working mines, of
    machines suitable for every industrial practice, of railroads, yes, of
    railroads whose network would certainly cover Lincoln Island one day.
</p>
<p>
    The engineer let Pencroff speak. He did not contradict the exaggerations
    of this brave heart. He well knew that confidence is catching. He even
    smiled to hear him speak and said nothing about the anxieties he
    sometimes had about the future. In fact, in this part of the Pacific,
    outside the ship lanes, he feared that they would never be rescued. It
    was thus on themselves, on themselves alone that the colonists must
    count, because the distance from Lincoln Island to any other land was
    such that to risk themselves in a boat of necessarily mediocre
    construction would be a serious and perilous thing.
</p>
<p>
    But, as the sailor said, they had accomplished a hundred times more than
    the Robinsons of a bygone time, for whom everything was done
    miraculously.
</p>
<p>
    And, in fact, they had knowledge, and the man who had knowledge would
    succeed where others would vegetate and inevitably perish.
</p>
<p>
    During these activities Herbert distinguished himself. He was intelligent
    and active, he learned quickly, worked well, and Cyrus Smith attached
    himself more and more to this lad. Herbert had a vivid and respectful
    regard for the engineer. Pencroff saw the close sympathy that formed
    between these two beings but he was not jealous of it.
</p>
<p>
    Neb was Neb. He was what he would always be, courageous, zealous,
    devoted, abnegation personified. He had the same faith in his master as
    Pencroff but he manifested it less noisily. When the sailor was
    enthusiastic, Neb always took an attitude as if to say “but nothing is
    more natural.” Pencroff and he liked each other and were not long in
    becoming friends.
</p>
<p>
    As to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work and he was not the
    most awkward one which always astonished the sailor a little. “A clever
    ‘journalist’ who not only understands everything, but can do everything!”
</p>
<p>
    The ladder was finally installed on the 28th of May. There were no less
    than a hundred rungs for this perpendicular height of eighty feet.
    Fortunately, Cyrus Smith had been able to divide it into two parts,
    profiting from an overhang in the wall which made a ledge forty feet
    above the ground. This ledge, carefully leveled with a pick, became a
    sort of landing on which they fixed the first ladder, whose swinging was
    thus diminished by half, and a cord permitted it to be raised to the
    level of Granite House. As to the second ladder, its lower end was also
    attached to the ledge, but its upper end was connected to the door
    itself. In this way, getting up was notably easier. Besides, Cyrus Smith
    counted on later installing a hydraulic lift, which would do away with
    all fatigue and all time lost by the inhabitants of Granite House.

<p>
    The colonists promptly became accustomed to the use of this ladder. They
    were nimble and skillful and Pencroff, since he was a sailor, accustomed
    to climbing the ratlines of the shrouds, was able to give them lessons.
    But it was necessary to give Top lessons also. The poor dog, with his
    four feet, was not made for this exercise. But Pencroff was so zealous a
    teacher that Top ended by being able to climb the ladder as well as his
    peers in the circus. It need not be said that the sailor was proud of his
    pupil. Nevertheless, more than once Pencroff put him on his back for
    which Top never complained.
</p>
<p>
    It should be noted here that during these works, which were actively
    carried on because the bad season was approaching, the question of food
    had not been neglected. The reporter and Herbert definitely became
    purveyors to the colony, devoting several hours every day to hunting.
    They still only exploited Jacamar Woods on the left of the river because
    they still could not cross the Mercy without a bridge or a boat. All of
    these immense forests to which they had given the name of Forests of the
    Far West, had not at all been explored. They reserved this important
    excursion for the first good days of the coming spring. But Jacamar Woods
    was full of game; kangaroos and wild boar abounded and the hunters did
    wonders with the iron tipped spears and the bow and arrows. In addition,
    Herbert discovered a natural warren near the southwest corner of the
    lagoon, a sort of slightly wet meadow covered with willows and aromatic
    herbs which perfumed the air, herbs such as thyme, serpolet, basil,
    savory, and all fragrant species of the labiate family which rabbits are
    so fond of.
</p>
<p>
    The reporter noted that since the table was served with things for
    rabbits, it would be astonishing if there were no rabbits. The two
    hunters carefully explored this warren. In any case, it produced an
    abundance of useful plants and a naturalist would have had a good
    opportunity there to study specimens of the vegetable kingdom. Herbert
    therefore collected a certain quantity of basil shoots, rosemary,
    melissa, betony, etc., which possessed various therapeutic properties for
    use as cough mixtures, astringents, antifebriles, others antispasmodics,
    or antirhumatics. And when later, Pencroff asked about this collection of
    herbs:
</p>
<p>
    “To take care of us,” replied the lad, “to treat us when we are ill.”
</p>
<p>
    “Since there are no doctors on the island, why should we be sick?”
    replied Pencroff, very seriously.
</p>
<p>
    To this there was nothing to reply but the lad nonetheless made his
    collection, which was very well received at Granite House. He was able to
    add to this stock of medicinal plants a quantity of didymous monardas
    which are known in North America under the name of “Oswego Tea,”
    producing an excellent beverage.
</p>
<p>
    Finally that day, on looking carefully, the two hunters arrived at the
    true location of the warren. The ground was riddled with holes.
</p>
<p>
    “Burrows!” cried Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    “Yes,” replied the reporter, “I see them well.”
</p>
<p>
    “But are they inhabited?”
</p>
<p>
    “That is the question.”
</p>
<p>
    The question was not long in resolving itself. Almost at once, hundreds
    of small animals resembling rabbits fled in all directions, and with such
    speed that even Top could not overtake them. Hunters and dog were soon
    out of breath and these rodents easily escaped them. But the reporter
    resolved not to leave the place before having captured at least half a
    dozen of these quadrupeds. He wanted first to supply the pantry and then
    to domesticate those which they would take later. With several nooses
    spread at the openings of the burrows, the operation could not fail to
    succeed. But at the moment they had neither nooses nor a way to make
    them. They hence had to resign themselves to visiting each refuge, to pry
    with a stick and to do with patience what they could not do in any other
    way.
</p>

    <img alt="Hundreds of small animals..." src="images/252.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Hundreds of small animals...</p>

<p>
    Finally, after an hour of digging, four rodents were taken. They were
    rabbits resembling their European congeners and who are commonly known
    under the name of “American Rabbits.”
</p>
<p>
    The result of the hunt was brought to Granite House and was a part of the
    evening meal. The hosts of this warren were not scorned because they were
    delicious. This was a precious resource for the colony, one which seemed
    to be inexhaustible.
</p>
<p>
    On the 31st of May, the partitions were completed. Nothing remained but
    to furnish the rooms, which would be the work for the long winter. A
    chimney was built in the first room which served as the kitchen. The
    tube, designed to conduct the smoke outside, gave some work for the
    improvised chimney makers. It seemed simpler to Cyrus Smith to make it
    out of brick clay. Since he could not dream of making an opening to the
    upper plateau, they excavated a hole through the granite above the window
    of the aforementioned kitchen and it was through this hole that the pipe
    was obliquely placed with a top like that of an iron stove. Perhaps, even
    doubtless, the chimney would smoke when the strong winds would beat
    directly against the facade, but these winds were rare and besides,
    Master Neb, the cook, did not mind it.
</p>
<p>
    When these interior arrangements had been finished, the engineer occupied
    himself with closing the opening of the old passageway which ended at the
    lake, in a way to prevent any access by this means. Lumps of rocks were
    hauled to the opening and firmly cemented. Cyrus Smith still had not
    begun the project of drowning this orifice under the water of the lake by
    returning them to their former level with a dam. He contented himself
    with concealing the obstruction with grass, bushes and brushwood which
    were planted in the crevices of the rocks and which would develop
    exuberantly next spring.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, he used the overflow in a way to bring a stream of sweet
    water into the new dwelling. A small groove, made below level, produced
    this result, and this diversion of a pure and inexhaustible source gave
    an output of twenty five to thirty gallons a day.<sup><a href=
                                                                     "#n1">1</a></sup> Water would never be lacking at
    Granite House.
</p>
<pic>
    <img alt="A small groove..." src="images/254.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>A small groove...</p>

<p>
    Finally, everything was completed and it was time because the bad season
    arrived. Thick shutters allowed them to close the windows of the facade
    while waiting for the time when the engineer could make plate glass.
</p>
<p>
    Gideon Spilett, being artistically inclined, planted various species of
    plants and long flowing grass on the rock ledges and around the windows.
    In this fashion the openings were enclosed in a picturesque greenery
    producing a charming effect.
</p>
<p>
    The inhabitants of this solid, safe and secure dwelling could only be
    enchanted with their work. The windows gave them a view which extended on
    a limitless horizon from the two Mandible Capes in the north to Cape Claw
    in the south. All of Union Bay was magnificently unfolded before them.
    Yes, these brave colonists had grounds for being satisfied and Pencroff
    spared no praise of what he humorously called his “apartment on the fifth
    floor above the mezzanine.”
