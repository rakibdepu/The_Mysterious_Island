<p class="huge">
    <b class="cap">The</b> first week in January was devoted to making the
    linen needed by the colony. The needles found in the case were used by
    vigorous if not sturdy fingers and the sewing was done well.
</p>
<p>
    There was no lack of thread thanks to Cyrus Smith’s idea of using the
    thread that had already served to sew up the balloon. These long threads
    were unraveled by Gideon Spilett and Herbert with admirable patience.
    Pencroff had to give up this work which irritated him beyond measure; but
    when it came to sewing, he had no equal. No one can be ignorant of the
    fact that sailors have a remarkable aptitude for the sewing profession.
</p>
<p>
    The cloth that composed the envelope of the balloon was then degreased by
    means of soda and potassium obtained from the incineration of plants so
    that the unvarnished cotton regained its suppleness and its natural
    elasticity; then subjected to the decoloration action of the atmosphere,
    it acquired a perfect whiteness.
</p>
<p>
    Several dozen shirts and socks—the latter unknitted of course but made of
    sewn cloth—were made. What pleasure it was for the colonists to dress
    again in white linen—very rough linen doubtless but they were not
    troubled by so small a matter—and to sleep between sheets which made the
    bunks of Granite House into quite substantial beds.
</p>

<p>
    It was also about this time that they made sealskin shoes, which
    opportunely replaced the shoes and the boots brought from America. These
    new shoes were large and wide and never pinched their feet.
</p>
<p>
    The heat was still with them at the beginning of the year of 1866 but
    that did not stop the hunting in the woods. Agoutis, peccaries,
    capybaras, kangaroos, hairy and feathery game truly abounded and Gideon
    Spilett and Herbert were good archers who did not waste a shot.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith recommended that they economize on munitions and he took
    measures to replenish the powder and the lead shot that had been found in
    the case and which he wished to save for the future. Who could know what
    hazards they would face one day in the event that they left their domain?
    They must prepare for future uncertainties by economizing their munitions
    and substitute for them other easily renewable substances.
</p>
<p>
    As to replacing the lead of which Cyrus Smith had found no trace on the
    island, he used, without detriment, small iron shot which was easy to
    make. These grains were not as heavy as the lead grains so they made them
    larger. Each charge contained less but the skill of the hunters made up
    for the deficiency. As to the powder, Cyrus Smith would have been able to
    make it since he had available saltpeter, sulphur and coal but this
    preparation required extreme care and without special tools it was
    difficult to produce in good quality.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith preferred to make pyroxyle, that is to say guncotton, a
    substance in which cotton in not necessary except for the cellulose. Now
    cellulose is nothing more than the elementary tissue of plants and it is
    found in a nearly perfect state of purity not only in cotton but in the
    fibrous textiles of hemp and flax, in paper, old linen, elder pith, etc.
    Now elder trees abounded on the island near the mouth of Red Creek. The
    colonists had already used the berries of these shrubbery trees of the
    honeysuckle family as a coffee.
</p>
<p>
    It was sufficient to collect the elder pith, that is to say the
    cellulose. The only other substance necessary for making pyroxyle was
    fuming nitric acid. Now, since Cyrus Smith had sulphuric acid available,
    he had already produced nitric acid easily by attacking saltpeter which
    was furnished by nature.
</p>
<p>
    He therefore resolved to make and use pyroxyle although he was aware of
    its rather serious disadvantages, that is to say a large variation in
    effect, an excessive inflammability since it ignites at 170° instead of
    240° and finally a too rapid detonation which could damage the guns. On
    the other hand, the advantages of pyroxyle are these, that it is not
    altered by humidity, that it does not foul up the gun and that its
    explosive force is quadruple that of ordinary powder.
</p>
<p>
    To make pyroxyle, it suffices to submerge the cellulose into fuming
    nitric acid for a quarter of an hour, then to wash it with water and dry
    it over a large fire. One can see that nothing is simpler.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith only had the ordinary nitric acid and not the fuming nitric
    acid or the monohydrate, that is to say the acid which emits white vapors
    on contact with humid air; but the engineer could substitute for the
    latter and obtain the same result by mixing ordinary nitric acid with
    sulphuric acid in the ratio of three to five by volume. This he did. The
    hunters soon had a well made substance which gave excellent results when
    used with discretion.
</p>
<p>
    About this time the colonists cleared three acres<sup><a href=
                                                                     "#n1">1</a></sup> of Grand View Plateau and the
    remainder was saved in
    the prairie state for the use of the onagers. Several excursions were
    made into the Jacamar and Far West forests and they brought back a true
    harvest of wild vegetables, spinach, cress, horse radish and turnips
    which would soon be cultivated. This would improve their diet. They also
    carried a lot of wood and coal. Each excursion had, at the same time,
    improved the roadway which settled down little by little under the wheels
    of the cart.
</p>
<p>
    The warren continued to furnish its quota of rabbits for the Granite
    House pantry. Since it was located just beyond Glycerin Creek, its hosts
    could not penetrate the guarded plateau nor ravage the newly made
    plantation. As to the oyster bed, located among the rocks of the beach
    and whose products were frequently renewed, it yielded excellent mollusks
    daily. Fishing either in the waters of the lake or in the Mercy was
    worthwhile because Pencroff had made some lines armed with iron hooks
    which frequently caught fine trout and certain extremely savoury fish
    whose silvery sides were covered with small yellow spots. In this way
    Master Neb, in charge of the culinary department, was able to agreeably
    vary the menu at each meal. Bread alone was still missing from the
    colonists’ table and, as was said, it was a privation which was truly
    felt.
</p>
<p>
    About this time they also hunted the tortoises which frequented the
    beaches of Cape Mandible. In this region the shore bristled with small
    mounds covering perfectly spherical eggs with a hard white shell whose
    albumin does not coagulate like bird eggs. It was the sun that made them
    hatch. There naturally was a considerable number since each tortoise can
    lay up to two hundred fifty annually.
</p>
<p>
    “A real egg field,” said Gideon Spilett, “and we have only to collect
    them.”
</p>
<p>
    But they were not content with these products. They also had a hunt for
    the producers, a hunt which allowed them to carry back to Granite House a
    dozen of these chelonians, truly very valuable from the alimentary point
    of view. Tortoise soup, enhanced with aromatic herbs and cruciferae,
    often drew merited praise for its preparer, Master Neb.
</p>
<p>
    A happy circumstance should be cited here, which allowed them to make
    additional provisions for the winter. Schools of salmon ventured into the
    Mercy and ascended the watercourse for several miles. This was the season
    in which the females, seeking suitable places for spawning, precede the
    males and make a lot of noise swimming through the sweet water. A
    thousand of these fish, which measured up to two and a half feet in
    length, crowded the river and they caught a large quantity by
    establishing several dams. Several hundred were salted and put in reserve
    for the time when winter, freezing the watercourse, would render all
    fishing impractical.
</p>
<p>
    It was at this time that the very intelligent Jup was promoted to the
    rank of valet. He had been dressed in a jacket, short breeches of white
    cloth, and an apron with pockets that he liked to shove his hands into.
    He did not mind that they saw him fumbling. The skillful orang had been
    well trained by Neb and one would say that the Negro and the ape
    understood each other when they chatted. Jup had, besides, an actual
    sympathy for Neb and Neb reciprocated. Unless they had need for his
    services, be it to haul some wood or to climb to the top of some tree,
    Jup passed most of his time in the kitchen trying to imitate Neb in
    everything that he saw him do. Besides, the master showed patience and
    even an extreme zeal in instructing his pupil and the pupil showed a
    remarkable intelligence in profiting from the lessons given to him by his
    master.

    <p>Jup passed most of his time in the kitchen.</p>
</pic>
<p>
    One can judge the satisfaction that he gave to the hosts of Granite House
    when one day, without any previous announcement, he came with a table
    napkin on his arm, ready to serve at the table. Skillful and attentive,
    he performed perfectly, changing the napkins, carrying the plates,
    pouring the drinks, all with a seriousness that amused the colonists to
    the last degree and delighted Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    “Jup, some soup!”
</p>
<p>
    “Jup, a little agouti!”
</p>
<p>
    “Jup, a napkin!”
</p>
<p>
    “Jup! Worthy Jup! Honest Jup!”
</p>
<p>
    Without becoming upset, Jup responded to everyone and observed
    everything. He shook his intelligent head when Pencroff, alluding to his
    joke on the first day, said to him:
</p>
<p>
    “Decidedly Jup, we must double your wages!”
</p>
<p>
    Needless to say, the orang had become completely acclimatized to Granite
    House and he often accompanied his masters into the forest without ever
    manifesting any desire to escape. At such times he marched in the most
    amusing fashion, with a cane that Pencroff had given him, carrying it on
    his shoulder like a gun. If they had to pluck some fruit from the top of
    a tree, how quickly he was up there! If the wheel of the cart became
    stuck in the mud how vigorously Jup got it back on the road with a single
    shove!
</p>
<p>
    “What a rascal!” Pencroff often cried. “If he was as mischievous as he is
    good, there would be no holding him back.”
</p>
<p>
    It was toward the end of January that the colonists undertook a large
    task in the central part of the island. It had been decided that at the
    foot of Mount Franklin near the sources of Red Creek, they would build a
    corral designed to hold the ruminants whose presence near Granite House
    would have been a nuisance, and especially those wild sheep which could
    furnish the wool that they expected to make into winter clothing.
</p>
<p>
    Every morning the colony, sometimes in its entirety, more often
    represented only by Cyrus Smith, Herbert and Pencroff, went to the
    sources of the creek with the aid of the onagers. This was a promenade of
    not more than five miles under a dome of verdure on this newly traced
    route which took the name of “Route to the Corral.”
</p>
<p>
    There a large piece of ground had been chosen on the very flank of the
    southern part of the mountain. It was a prairie, planted with clusters of
    trees, situated at the very foot of a buttress which enclosed it on one
    side. A small brook, having its source among the slopes, flowed
    diagonally across the area and fed into Red Creek. The grass grew well
    and the few trees allowed the air to circulate freely. It sufficed then
    to enclose the said prairie with a palisade which would be supported at
    each corner by a buttress. Being rather high, the most agile animals
    would not be able to cross it. This enclosure would contain, at any one
    time, about a hundred horned animals, wild sheep or goats, with young
    that would be born in time.
</p>
<p>
    The perimeter of the corral was marked off by the engineer and they then
    proceeded to cut the trees needed to construct the palisade; but, since
    in making the road it had already been necessary to sacrifice about a
    hundred trees, they were used as stakes which were firmly planted in the
    ground.
</p>
<p>
    At the front of the palisade, a rather large entrance was arranged and
    closed with two swing doors made of very thick planks which could be shut
    by exterior cross bars.
</p>
<p>
    The construction of the corral required not less than three weeks because
    in addition to the work on the palisade, Cyrus Smith built large planked
    sheds under which the ruminants could find shelter. Besides, it had been
    necessary to make it very sturdy because wild sheep are robust animals
    and their first violence was to be feared. The stakes, pointed on top and
    hardened in fire, were made strong by means of regularly placed iron
    bolts which assured the strength of the entire structure.
</p>
<p>
    The corral finished, a game drive was then undertaken to the foot of
    Mount Franklin amid the pastures frequented by the ruminants. This
    operation was made on the 7th of February, a fine summer day and everyone
    took part in it. The two onagers, well broken in by this time, were
    mounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert and rendered a useful service on
    this occasion.
</p>
<p>
    The maneuver consisted simply of pressing down on the sheep and goats and
    little by little narrowing the field of battle around them. Cyrus Smith,
    Pencroff, Neb and Jup posted themselves at various points in the woods,
    while the two horsemen and Top galloped within a radius of a half a mile
    around the corral.
</p>
<p>
    The wild sheep were numerous in this portion of the island. These fine
    animals, large as deer, horns stronger than those of a ram, with gray
    fleece blending with long hair, resembled argalis.
</p>
<p>
    This hunting day was tiring. What comings and goings, crossing and
    criss-crossing and commotion! Of the hundred wild sheep surrounded, more
    than two thirds escaped; but in the end thirty of these ruminants and a
    dozen wild goats, driven little by little toward the corral whose open
    door seemed to offer an outlet, threw themselves inside and were
    imprisoned.
</p>
<p>
    In sum the result was satisfying and the colonists could not complain.
    For the most part, these wild sheep were females, several of whom would
    not be long in giving birth. It was certain that the flock would prosper
    not only to provide wool but also hides in the not too distant future.
</p>
<p>
    That evening the hunters returned to Granite House exhausted. However,
    the next day they returned, at least to visit the corral. The prisoners
    had been trying to turn over the palisade but they had not succeeded and
    they were not long in becoming more tranquil.
</p>
<p>
    During the month of February no important event occurred. The daily tasks
    were regularly pursued. At the same time as they improved the roads to
    the corral and to Port Balloon, a third was begun from the enclosure to
    the western shore. The deep woods which covered Serpentine Peninsula were
    still an unknown portion of Lincoln Island. Gideon Spilett counted on
    purging from his domain the wild beasts that took refuge there.
</p>
<p>
    Before the return of the cold season, the most assiduous care was given
    to the cultivation of the wild plants that had been transplanted from the
    forest to Grand View Plateau. Herbert hardly ever returned from an
    excursion without bringing back some useful vegetable. One day it was a
    specimen of the chicoriaceae species whose seed, under pressure, makes an
    excellent oil; on another day it was the common sorrel whose
    antiscorbutic properties are not to be disdained; then some of the
    precious tubercles which have been cultivated at all times in South
    America, these potatoes which nowadays are counted as more than two
    hundred species. The kitchen garden, now in good repair, well watered and
    well defended against birds, was divided into small plots where lettuce,
    kidney beans, sorrel, turnips, horse radish and other cruciferous plants
    grew. The earth of the plateau was very fertile and they could hope that
    the harvest would be abundant.
</p>
<p>
    Various beverages were no longer lacking and, on the condition that one
    did not ask for wine, the most difficult people would have no cause to
    complain. To the Oswego tea furnished by the didymous monarda and the
    fermented liqueur extracted from the dragon tree roots, Cyrus Smith had
    added a real beer; he made it with the young shoots of the “abies nigra”
    which, after having been boiled and fermented, gave a particularly
    healthy and pleasant beverage which the Anglo-Americans call “spring
    beer,” that is to say fir tree beer.
</p>
<p>
    About the end of the summer the poultry yard possessed a fine pair of
    bustards who belonged to the “houbara” species characterized by a sort of
    apron of feathers, a dozen shovellers, whose upper jaw is extended on
    each side by a membranous appendage, and some magnificent black crested
    cocks with a carbuncle and epidermis resembling the cocks of Mozambique,
    who strutted on the banks of the lake.
</p>
<p>
    Thus everything was successful thanks to the activity of these courageous
    and intelligent men. Providence had doubtless done much for them; but
    faithful to principles, they had first helped themselves and heaven came
    to their aid afterwards.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of a warm summer’s day, when work was finished and a breeze
    came up from the sea, they loved to sit at the edge of Grand View Plateau
    under a sort of veranda covered with creeping vines that Neb had erected
    with his own hands. There they chatted, they instructed one another, they
    made plans, the sailor’s good humor always entertaining this small world
    in which perfect harmony never ceased to reign.
</p>
<p>
    They also spoke of their country, of dear and wonderful America. What of
    the War of Secession? It evidently could not have continued. Richmond had
    doubtless fallen promptly into the hands of General Grant! The capture of
    the Confederate capital had to be the last act of this deadly struggle!
    Now the North had triumphed for a good cause. Ah! How a newspaper would
    have been welcomed by the exiles of Lincoln Island! For eleven months all
    communication between them and the rest of humanity had been interrupted
    and in a little while the 24th of March would mark the anniversary of the
    day when the balloon had thrown them on this unknown shore! Then they
    were only castaways, not even knowing if they could wrest a miserable
    existence from the elements. And now thanks to the knowledge of their
    chief, thanks to their own intelligence, they were true colonists,
    provided with arms, tools and instruments, who had known how to transform
    to their profit the animals, plants and minerals of the island, that is
    to day the three kingdoms of nature.
</p>
<p>
    Yes! They often spoke of these things and made additional plans for the
    future!
</p>
<p>
    As to Cyrus Smith, for the most part silent, he listened to his
    companions more often than he spoke. Now and then he smiled at some of
    Herbert’s thoughts or at some of Pencroff’s witticisms but, at all times
    and everywhere he thought about those inexplicable events, about this
    strange enigma whose secret still escaped him.
