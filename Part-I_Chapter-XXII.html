      <b class="cap">This</b> intense frost lasted until the 15th of August
      without however dropping below the temperature already noted. When the
      weather was calm, this low temperature was easily tolerated but when the
      cold wind blew, it was hard on these insufficiently dressed men. Pencroff
      regretted that Lincoln Island had not given sanctuary to several families
      of bears instead of foxes or seals, whose fur leaves much to be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bears,” he said, “are generally well dressed, and I will ask nothing
      more of them than to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which are on
      their bodies.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” replied Neb laughing, “perhaps these bears will not consent,
      Pencroff, to give you their cloaks. These animals are not Saint-Martins!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will compel them, Neb. We will compel them,” replied Pencroff, in a
      completely authoritative tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these formidable carnivores did not exist on the island, or at least
      they had not shown themselves until then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Herbert, Pencroff and the reporter made traps on Grand View
      Plateau and at the approaches to the forest. In the sailor’s opinion,
      every animal, whatever it be, would be a good prize, and the rodents or
      carnivores who would use the new traps would be well received at Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, these traps were extremely simple: Holes dug in the ground, a
      platform of branches and grass above to hide the opening, some bait at
      the bottom whose odor would attract the animals, that was all. It should
      be said that these traps were not dug at random but at certain places
      where numerous footprints indicated the frequent passage of quadrupeds.
      They were visited every day. Three times during the first days they found
      specimens there of the colpeos that had already been seen on the right
      bank of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are there nothing but foxes in this country?” cried Pencroff, the third
      time that he pulled out one of these animals from the pit. He was very
      crestfallen. “These animals are good for nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But yes,” said Gideon Spilett. “They are good for something.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To make bait to attract others.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter was right and the traps were henceforth baited with the
      corpses of the foxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor also made collars using juncus fibers and the collars were
      more profitable than the traps. It was a rare day without some rabbit
      captured from the warren. It was always rabbit, but Neb knew how to vary
      his sauces and the guests did not dream of complaining. However one or
      two times, in the second week of August, the traps delivered to the
      hunters other animals more useful than the colpeos. There were several of
      these wild boars that had already been sighted to the north of the lake.
      Pencroff had no need to ask if these animals were edible. This was
      obvious from their resemblance to the pigs of America or Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor leaned over the trap. By the small appendage which serves it
      as a tail, he took out one of these representatives of the suilline
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But these are not pigs. I warn you, Pencroff,” Herbert said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My boy,” replied the sailor, “let me believe that these are pigs.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>“Let me beleive...” said Pencroff.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “And why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because it pleases me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You really like the pig, Pencroff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I love the pig a lot,” answered the sailor, “especially for its feet,
      and if it had eight feet instead of four I would love it twice as much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of
      the four genuses that make up the family. They were indeed of the
      “tajacu” species, recognizable by their dark color and deprived of those
      long canine teeth that arm the mouths of their congeners. These peccaries
      ordinarily live in groups and it was likely that they abounded in the
      wooded parts of the island. In any event they were edible from head to
      toe and Pencroff asked nothing more of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the 15th of August, the weather was suddenly changed by a northwest
      wind. The temperature rose several degrees and the accumulated vapor in
      the air was not long in changing to snow. The entire island was covered
      with a white layer and showed itself to its inhabitants under a new
      aspect. This snow fell abundantly for several days and soon attained a
      thickness of two feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind soon freshened with an extreme violence and from the height of
      Granite House they could hear the sea growling on the reef. There were
      rapid eddies of air in certain corners and the snow, forming in tall
      rotating columns, resembled those waterspouts which twirl at their base
      and which vessels attack by cannon fire. The storm however came from the
      northwest, taking hold of the island from the rear. The orientation of
      Granite House preserved it from a direct assault. But in the midst of
      this snow blast, as terrible as if it was produced in some polar country,
      neither Cyrus Smith nor his companions were able, in spite of their
      desire, to venture outside and they remained shut up for five days, from
      the 20th to the 25th of August. They heard the tempest roar in Jacamar
      Woods which was sure to suffer from it. Doubtless many trees would be
      uprooted but Pencroff consoled himself by thinking that it would save him
      the trouble of cutting them down.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>From the height of Granite House.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “The wind is woodsman, let it work,” he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And besides, he had no means of restraining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What thanks the hosts of Granite House then gave to heaven for having
      made for them this solid and steadfast retreat! Cyrus Smith deserved a
      legitimate part of these thanks but after all, it was nature that had
      excavated this vast cavern and he had only discovered it. There, all were
      safe and the storms could not reach them. If they had constructed a house
      of bricks and wood on Grand View Plateau, it would certainly not have
      resisted the fury of this storm. As to the Chimneys, the noise made by
      the waves led them to believe that it was absolutely uninhabitable
      because the sea, passing over the islet, must beat it with rage. But
      here, in Granite House, inside this block, neither water nor air could
      harm them and there was nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these days of sequestration the colonists did not remain inactive.
      Wood, cut into planks, was not lacking in the storeroom and little by
      little they completed the furniture. The tables and chairs were sturdy,
      to be sure, because material was not spared. This somewhat heavy
      furniture hardly justified its name since mobility is an essential
      condition but Neb and Pencroff were proud of it and would not have
      exchanged it for any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the woodworkers became basketmakers and they did not succeed badly
      at this new task. They had discovered, near a corner of the lake that
      projected northward, a prolific osier bed where a large number of purple
      osiers grew. Before the rainy season, Pencroff and Herbert had harvested
      these useful bushes and their branches were used well. The first attempts
      were shapeless but thanks to the skill and intelligence of the basket
      makers who, consulting, recalling the models they had seen, emulating
      each other, some large and small baskets soon accrued to the colony. The
      storeroom was provided with them and there Neb stored his harvest of
      rhizomes, pine almonds and the roots of the dragon tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last week of this month of August, the weather changed once
      more. The temperature dropped a little and it became calm. The colonists
      went outside. There was certainly two feet of snow on the beach but the
      surface of this snow was hard so they could walk on it without much
      difficulty. Cyrus Smith and his companions climbed to Grand View Plateau.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      What a change! These woods which they had left green, especially the
      neighboring parts where the conifers dominated, had disappeared under a
      uniform color. All was white from the top of Mount Franklin to the shore,
      the forests, the prairie, the lake, the river, the beaches. The water of
      the Mercy ran under a canopy of ice which broke up at each rise and fall
      of the tide, shattering loudly. Numerous birds fluttered on the solid
      surface of the lake, ducks and woodcocks, pintails and guillemots.
      Thousands were there. The rocks between which the cascade poured out on
      to the beach, bristled with ice. It could be said that the water escaped
      from a monstrous gargoyle made with all the fantasy of a renaissance
      artist. As to judging the damage done to the forest by the storm, they
      still could not do it, and it would be necessary to wait until the
      immense white layer was dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, Pencroff and Neb used this occasion to visit their traps.
      They could not find them easily under the snow which covered them. They
      had to take care not to fall into one or the other. This would have been
      simultaneously dangerous and humiliating: to be caught in one’s one trap!
      But they avoided this unpleasantness and found the traps perfectly
      intact. No animal had fallen in, but there were many footprints all about
      including certain clearly revealed claw marks. Herbert did not hesitate
      to affirm that some carnivore of the feline genre had passed there. This
      justified the engineer’s opinion on the presence of dangerous beasts on
      Lincoln Island. Doubtless these animals ordinarily inhabited the thick
      forests of the Far West but pressed on by hunger, they had ventured up to
      Grand View Plateau. Perhaps they smelled the hosts of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In short, what kind of felines are these?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are tigers,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe that these animals are found only in warm countries.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the new continent,” replied the lad, “they are observed from Mexico
      to the pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, since Lincoln Island is very nearly
      on the same latitude as the province of La Plata, it is not astonishing
      that several tigers are encountered here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good, we will keep an eye out for them,” answered Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the snow ended by dissipating under the influence of the rising
      temperature. Rain fell and thanks to its dissolving action the white
      layer disappeared. In spite of the bad weather, the colonists renewed
      their reserve of everything, pine almonds, dragon tree roots, rhizomes,
      maple syrup for the vegetable part; rabbits from the warren, agoutis and
      kangaroos for the animal part. This necessitated several excursions into
      the forest and they noted that a certain quantity of trees had been
      thrown down by the last storm. The sailor and Neb even hauled the cart up
      to the coal bed in order to bring back several tons of fuel. They saw in
      passing that the chimney of the pottery furnace had been extensively
      damaged by the wind and that at least six feet had been knocked off the
      top.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provision of wood was also renewed at Granite House at the same time
      as the coal and they profited by the current of the Mercy, which had
      become free, to bring in several loads. They could see that the period of
      severe cold was not over.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visit was also made to the Chimneys and the colonists could only
      congratulate themselves that they had not lived there during the storm.
      The sea had left incontestable marks of its ravages. Driven on by the
      open winds and passing over the islet, the sea had violently assailed the
      passageways which were half buried in the sand. Thick layers of seaweed
      covered the rocks. While Neb, Herbert and Pencroff hunted or renewed the
      supply of fuel, Cyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett cleaned up the Chimneys,
      finding the forge and the furnace almost intact, protected from the first
      by the sand covering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fuel had not been renewed in vain. The colonists had not finished
      with the rigorous frost. As is known, in the northern hemisphere, the
      month of February is noted for its large drops in temperature. It is the
      same in the southern hemisphere and the end of the month of August, which
      is the February of North America, did not escape this climatic law.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the 25th, after a new change between snow and rain, the wind blew
      from the southeast and suddenly the cold became extremely brisk.
      According to the engineer’s estimate, the column of mercury on a
      Fahrenheit thermometer would not have marked less than 8° below zero
      (22.22° centigrade below freezing). Rendered more painful by the sharp
      wind, this intense frost kept up for several days. The colonists were
      again shut up in Granite House. Since it was necessary to hermetically
      seal all openings of the facade leaving only a small passage for the
      renewal of air, the consumption of candles was considerable. In order to
      economize them, the colonists often used only the light from the
      fireplace where they did not spare the fuel. Several times one or the
      other descended to the beach amid the ice floes that piled up with each
      tide but they soon climbed back to Granite House and it was not without
      pain and without suffering that their hands held on to the rungs of the
      ladder. With this intense frost, the rungs burnt their fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was again necessary to occupy the leisure imposed on the hosts of
      Granite House. Cyrus Smith then undertook an operation suited to indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that the colonists had no sugar other than this liquid substance
      that they drew from the maple by making deep incisions in this tree. It
      sufficed for them to collect this liqueur into vases and they used it in
      this state for various culinary uses, so much the more that on aging the
      liqueur tended to become white and took on a syrupy consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was something better to make and one day Cyrus Smith announced
      to his companions that they were going to become refiners.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Refiners!” replied Pencroff. “That is a somewhat warm profession, I
      believe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very warm,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then it will be in season,” answered the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word refining should not bring to mind complicated factories, tools
      and workmen. No! To crystalize this liqueur, it suffices to purify it by
      an extremely easy operation. Placed on a fire in large earthen vases, it
      was simply subjected to a certain evaporation and soon a scum rose to the
      surface. When it began to thicken, Neb took care to stir it with a wooden
      spatula, which accelerated its evaporation and at the same time prevented
      it from acquiring an empyreumatic taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      After boiling for several hours on a good fire, which did as much good to
      the operators as to the substance operated on, it was transformed to a
      thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay molds previously made in the
      same kitchen stove, and to which they had given various shapes. The next
      day this syrup solidified, forming cakes and tablets. It was sugar of a
      slightly reddish color but nearly transparent and with a perfect taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frost continued to mid-September and the prisoners of Granite House
      began to find their captivity rather long. Nearly every day they made
      several sorties which they could not prolong. They therefore worked
      constantly on the arrangements for the dwelling. They chatted while
      working. Cyrus Smith instructed his companions in all things and
      principally he explained to them the practical applications of science.
      The colonists did not have a library at their disposal, but the engineer
      was a book that was always ready, always open to the page that each one
      needed, a book which answered all their questions and which they often
      leafed through. So the time passed and these brave men had no doubts
      about the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was time for their confinement to end. All were in a hurry to
      see, if not the fine season, at least the end of this insupportable
      frost. If only they had been dressed in a way to be able to brave it,
      what excursions they would have made either to the dunes or to Tadorn
      Marsh. The game would have been easy to approach and the hunt would have
      assuredly been fruitful. But Cyrus Smith maintained that no one should
      compromise his health since he had need of all hands, and his advice was
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it must be said, the most impatient of the prisoners, after Pencroff
      of course, was Top. The faithful dog found Granite House too confining.
      He came and went from one room to the other, showing from his manner, his
      boredom in being cooped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith often remarked that when he came near the gloomy well which
      was in communication with the sea and whose opening was at the base of
      the storeroom, that he made singular grunts. Top turned around this hole
      which had been covered with a wooden panel. Sometimes he even tried to
      slip his paws under this panel as if he wanted to lift it. He then yapped
      in a particular way which indicated anger and uneasiness at the same
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer observed this behavior several times. What was there in this
      abyss that could impress the intelligent animal? The well led to the sea,
      that was certain. Did it also branch out through narrow passageways
      across the framework of the island? Was it in communication with several
      other interior cavities? Did some marine monster come from time to time
      to breath at the bottom of this well? The engineer did not know what to
      think and he couldn’t help but imagine bizarre complications. Accustomed
      to the domain of scientific reality, he could not pardon himself for
      drifting into the domain of the strange and almost supernatural. Top was
      one of those sensible dogs who did not waste their time in barking at the
      moon but how could he explain why the dog insisted on probing this abyss
      with his smell and hearing if there was nothing to arouse his uneasiness?
      Top’s conduct intrigued Cyrus Smith more than he admitted to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, the engineer communicated his impressions only to Gideon
      Spilett, finding it pointless to tell his companions about these
      involuntary thoughts that arose within himself and which perhaps were due
      only to Top’s whims.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the frost ended. There was rain, squalls mixed with snow, showers
      and windstorms, but this bad weather did not last long. The ice
      dissolved, the snow melted; the beach, the plateau, the banks of the
      Mercy and the forests became passable once again. The return of
      springtime delighted the hosts of Granite House and soon they passed
      there only the hours for sleeping and for meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did a lot of hunting in the second half of September which brought
      Pencroff to call again for firearms which he said had been promised by
      Cyrus Smith. The latter, knowing well that without special tools it was
      almost impossible to make a gun that would be of service, always held
      back and put off the operation for a later time. He noted, moreover, that
      Herbert and Gideon Spilett had become skillful archers, that all sorts of
      excellent animals, agoutis, kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild
      duck, snipe, in short that hairy or feathery game fell under their arrows
      and consequently that they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would not
      hear of it and did not cease to remind the engineer that he had not
      satisfied his desire. Besides, Gideon Spilett seconded Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the island, as we have no reason to doubt,” he said, “contains
      ferocious animals, we should think of fighting them and exterminating
      them. A time may come when this will become our first duty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this period, it was not this question of firearms which
      preoccupied Cyrus Smith but that of clothing. The colonists had passed
      the winter with those that they wore, but these would not last until the
      next winter. They would have to procure the furs of some carnivores or
      the wool of ruminants at any price. Since there was no lack of sheep, it
      would be advisable to start a flock which would be raised for the needs
      of the colony. An enclosure for domestic animals, a poultry yard laid out
      for the fowl, in a word a sort of farm to establish at some point on the
      island, such were the two important projects to execute during the fine
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, and in view of these future establishments, it thus became
      urgent to conduct a reconnaissance of all the unknown parts of Lincoln
      Island, that is to say in the deep forests which extended on the right of
      the Mercy from its mouth to the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula, as
      well as all of the western shore. But better weather was needed and a
      month must pass before this exploration could be properly undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They therefore waited with some impatience when an incident occurred
      which further excited the desire of the colonists to visit their entire
      domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 24th of October. On this day Pencroff had gone to visit the
      traps which he always kept decently baited. In one of these he found
      three animals which would be welcome back home. It was a female peccary
      and her two young ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture and, as
      usual, the sailor made a big show over his hunt.

    <p>
      “Come! We will make a good meal, Mister Cyrus,” he cried. “And you too,
      Mister Spilett, you will eat it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do so want to eat,” replied the reporter, “but what is it that I will
      eat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Piglet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, really, piglet, Pencroff? To hear you speak, I would think you were
      bringing a young truffled partridge!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How’s this?” cried Pencroff. “Are you perchance making fun of my
      piglet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm, “provided
      one does not overdo it...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is good, that is good, Mister journalist,” retorted the sailor, who
      did not like to hear his hunt depreciated. “You are difficult. And seven
      months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been very happy
      to meet with similar game!...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, there,” replied the reporter. “Man is never happy nor content.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied Pencroff, “I hope that Neb will distinguish himself.
      Look! These two young peccaries are not even three months old! They will
      be as tender as quails. Come Neb, let’s go. I will oversee the cooking
      myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor, followed by Neb, went into the kitchen where they became
      absorbed in their culinary labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did it their way. Neb and he then prepared a magnificent meal, the
      two young peccaries, a kangaroo soup, a smoked ham, some pine almonds,
      dragon tree beverage, some Oswego tea, in short, the best of everything;
      but the best of all the dishes was the savory peccaries, prepared
      braised.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o’clock dinner was served in the hall of Granite House. The
      kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the soup came the peccaries which Pencroff wanted to slice himself.
      He served monstrous portions to each of his fellow diners.
    </p>
    <p>
      These piglets were truly delicious and Pencroff devoured his portion with
      gusto when all of a sudden a cry and an oath escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s... It’s... I broke a tooth!” replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So! Are there are pebbles in your peccaries?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so,” replied Pencroff, drawing from his lips the object which
      had cost him a molar!...
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a pebble... It was a lead bullet.
