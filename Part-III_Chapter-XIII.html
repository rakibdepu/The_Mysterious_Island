    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">What</b> had happened? Who had struck down the convicts?
      Was it Ayrton? No, since he had dreaded their return only a moment
      earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ayrton was then in a deep stupor from which it was impossible to
      rouse him. After the few words that he uttered, an overwhelming torpor
      took possession of him and he fell back on his bed motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the influence
      of a violent overexcitement, waited all night without leaving Ayrton’s
      house and without returning to the place where the bodies of the convicts
      were lying. It was true that Ayrton could tell them nothing about the
      circumstances under which the convicts had been found dead since he
      himself did not even know that he was at the corral. But at least he
      would be able to tell about the events that had preceded this terrible
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Ayrton came out of his torpor and his companions heartily
      gave him evidence of their joy on seeing him again very nearly safe and
      sound after one hundred four days of separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton then related in a few words what had happened or at least as much
      as he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after his arrival at the corral, the 10th of November last, when
      night fell, he was surprised by the convicts who had scaled the
      enclosure. They tied and gagged him; then he was taken away to some
      obscure cavern at the foot of Mount Franklin where the convicts had taken
      refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His death had been decided upon and the next day he was about to be
      killed when one of the convicts recognized him and called him by the name
      he had borne in Australia. These wretches wanted to massacre Ayrton! They
      respected Ben Joyce!
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that time on, Ayrton was exposed to the obsessions of his former
      accomplices. They wanted him to join with them and they counted on him to
      get into Granite House, to get into this inaccessible dwelling, in order
      to become masters of the island after having assassinated the colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton resisted. The former convict, repentant and pardoned, would have
      rather died than betray his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton, tied up, gagged and under constant guard, lived in this cavern
      for four months.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after their
      arrival on the island and from that time on, they used its reserves but
      without living there. On the 11th of November, two of these bandits,
      suddenly surprised by the arrival of the colonists, fired on Herbert and
      one of them returned boasting that he had killed one of the inhabitants
      of the island, but he returned alone. His companion, as we know, fell
      under Cyrus Smith’s dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can judge Ayrton’s despair and anxiety when he learned this news of
      Herbert’s death! The colonists were only four in number and, so to speak,
      at the mercy of the convicts!
    </p>
    <p>
      After this event, and during all of the time that the colonists were
      detained at the corral by Herbert’s illness, the pirates did not leave
      their cavern, and even after they had pillaged Grand View Plateau, they
      did not feel it prudent to abandon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ill treatment inflicted on Ayrton then redoubled. His hands and feet
      still carried the bloody marks of the bonds which restrained him day and
      night. He awaited death at any moment, from which it seemed he could not
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things stood this way until the third week in February. The convicts,
      always on the lookout for a favorable occasion, rarely left their retreat
      except to hunt either in the interior of the island or on the southern
      coast. Ayrton no longer had any news of his friends nor did he expect to
      see them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the unfortunate man, weak from ill-treatment, fell into a deep
      prostration during which he saw nor heard anything. From that time on,
      that is to say for the last two days, he could not even say what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, Mister Smith,” he added, “since I was imprisoned in this cavern,
      how do I find myself at the corral?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do we find the convicts lying out there dead in the middle of the
      enclosure?” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dead!” shouted Ayrton who, in spite of his weakness, got up a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions helped him up. He wanted to stand up. They let him do so
      and everyone went toward the small creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was broad daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There on the bank, in the position in which they had met an instantaneous
      death, lay the five bodies of the convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton was dumfounded. Cyrus Smith and his companions looked at him
      without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroff examined the bodies already
      stiff from the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They showed no apparent trace of a wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only after they had been carefully examined, Pencroff saw on the face of
      one, the chest of another, the back of this one, the shoulder of that
      one, a small red mark, a sort of barely visible contusion whose origin
      was impossible to recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is how they were struck down!” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But with what kind of weapon?” shouted the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A weapon, acting like lightning, whose secret we do not have.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who struck them?...” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The judge of the island,” replied Cyrus Smith, “he who brought you here,
      Ayrton, he whose influence is still felt, he who does for us all that we
      cannot do for ourselves, and who, when done, conceals himself from us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us look for him then,” shouted Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, let us look for him,” replied Cyrus Smith, “but the mysterious
      being who accomplishes such wonders will not be found until it finally
      pleases him to call us to his side.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This invisible protection, which made their own efforts seem like
      nothing, irritated and moved the engineer at the same time. The relative
      inferiority that it implied could wound a proud spirit. A generosity
      which acted so as to elude every mark of recognition indicated a sort of
      scorn for the debtors which marred up to a certain point, in Cyrus
      Smith’s view, the value of the kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us search,” he resumed, “and God will it that we be permitted one
      day to prove to this haughty protector that he is not dealing with
      ingrates! What I would not give to be able to repay him and to render him
      some important service in our turn even at the cost of our lives.”
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day on, this search was the unique preoccupation of the
      inhabitants of Lincoln Island. Everything impelled them to discover a
      hint about this enigma, a hint even if it only be the name of the man
      endowed with this truly inexplicable and superhuman power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the colonists re-entered the house in the corral where their cares
      promptly restored Ayrton to his moral and physical energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Pencroff carried the bodies of the convicts into the forest at
      some distance from the corral and buried them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton was brought up to date on what had occurred during his
      imprisonment. He was told about Herbert’s experiences and the series of
      trials which the colonists had endured. As to the latter, they no longer
      expected to see Ayrton again and feared that the convicts had massacred
      him without pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now,” said Cyrus Smith, ending his recital, “a duty remains for us.
      Half of our task is completed but if the convicts are no longer to be
      feared, it is not because of ourselves that we have again become masters
      of the island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied Gideon Spilett, “let us search every labyrinth of the
      buttresses of Mount Franklin! Let us leave no excavation or hole
      unexplored. No reporter ever found himself in the presence of so exciting
      a mystery, I can tell you that, my friends!” “And we will return to
      Granite House,” replied Herbert, “only when we have found our
      benefactor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the engineer, “we will do everything that it is humanly
      possible to do... but, I repeat, we will not find him until he wishes
      it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we stay at the corral?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us stay here,” replied Cyrus Smith. “There are abundant provisions
      here and we are at the center of our circle of investigations. Besides,
      if necessary, the cart can quickly take us to Granite House.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good,” replied the sailor. “Only an observation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fine season is advanced and we must not forget that we have a trip
      to make.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A trip?” said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! The one to Tabor Island,” replied Pencroff. “It is necessary to
      bring a notice there which indicates the position of our island where
      Ayrton actually is, in case the Scotch yacht comes to bring him back. Who
      knows if it is not already too late?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Pencroff,” asked Ayrton, “how do you plan to make this trip?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the <i>Bonadventure</i>!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Bonadventure</i>!” shouted Ayrton. “It no longer exists.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My <i>Bonadventure</i> no longer exists!” yelled Pencroff jumping up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No!” replied Ayrton. “The convicts discovered it in its small port, it
      was barely eight days ago, they took it to sea, and...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And?” said Pencroff with his heart palpitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And not having Bob Harvey to maneuver it, they became stranded on the
      rocks and the boat was completely destroyed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! the wretches! the bandits! the infamous scoundrels!” shouted
      Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pencroff,” said Herbert, taking the sailor’s hand, “we will make another
      <i>Bonadventure</i>, a larger one. We have all the ironwork and all the
      rigging from the brig.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But do you know,” replied Pencroff, “that it will take at least five to
      six months to construct a boat of thirty to forty tons?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will take our time,” replied the reporter, “and we will give up our
      trip to Tabor Island for this year.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As much as you want it, Pencroff, it is best to be resigned,” said the
      engineer, “and I hope that this delay will not be detrimental.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! my <i>Bonadventure</i>! my poor <i>Bonadventure</i>!” shouted
      Pencroff, truly disheartened by the loss of his boat, to which he had
      become so attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      The destruction of the <i>Bonadventure</i> was evidently a regrettable
      fact for the colonists and it was agreed that this loss would be repaired
      as soon as possible. This decided, they would now occupy themselves only
      with bringing the exploration of the most secret portions of the island
      to a successful conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search was begun on that very day, the 19th of February, and lasted
      an entire week. The base of the mountain, between the buttresses and
      their numerous ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and elevated
      ground very randomly disposed. It was evident that it would be best to
      pursue their search there at the bottom of these narrow gorges, perhaps
      even into the interior of the mass of Mount Franklin. No part of the
      island would be a better place to conceal a dwelling whose host wanted to
      remain unknown. But such was the entanglement of the buttresses, that
      Cyrus Smith had to proceed to explore them in a strictly methodical way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists first visited all of the valley which opened up to the
      south of the volcano, which fed the waters of Falls River. It was there
      that Ayrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge
      and in which he had been imprisoned until he had been taken to the
      corral. This cavern was exactly in the condition as when Ayrton had left
      it. They found there a certain quantity of munitions and provisions that
      the convicts had built up with the intention of creating a reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the valley which was adjacent to the cave, a valley shaded by
      beautiful trees, among which the conifers were dominant, was explored
      with extreme care. The southwest buttress having been turned, the
      colonists came upon a more narrow gorge which led to the picturesque
      entanglement of basalts on the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there were fewer trees. Stone replaced grass. Wild goats and sheep
      gamboled about among the rocks. Here the arid part of the island began.
      They saw that of the numerous valleys at the base of Mount Franklin, only
      three were wooded and rich in pastures like those of the corral which was
      bordered on the west by Falls River valley and on the east by Red Creek
      valley. These two brooks changed into rivers lower down by the absorption
      of several affluents formed by all of the mountain’s waters and thus
      accounted for the fertility of the southern portion. As to the Mercy, it
      was more directly fed from abundant sources lost under the cover of
      Jacamar Woods and from other sources of this nature which, overflowing
      from a thousand outlets, watered the soil of Serpentine Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now one of these three valleys, where there was no lack of water, could
      serve as a retreat for some recluse who would find there all the things
      necessary for life. But the colonists had already explored them and
      nowhere had they been able to affirm the presence of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it then at the bottom of these arid gorges, among the debris of rocks
      in the rugged ravines of the north, between the paths of lava, that this
      retreat found itself with its host?
    </p>
    <p>
      The base of the northern part of Mount Franklin was composed of only two
      valleys, broad, not too deep, without the appearance of vegetation,
      erratic blocks scattered about, long moraines paved with lava, hills of
      large mineral deposits interspersed with volcanic glass and labradorites.
      This part called for a long and difficult exploration. It was
      criss-crossed by a thousand cavities, doubtless of little comfort, but
      absolutely concealed and of difficult access. The colonists even visited
      dark tunnels which dated from the plutonian epoch, still black from the
      passage of former fires, and which led into the mass of the mountain.
      They went through dark galleries with resin torches, they probed the
      smallest excavations, they sounded the least depths. But there was
      silence and darkness everywhere. It did not seem that any human being had
      ever trod these ancient passageways or that his hands had even moved a
      single block. They were there just as the volcano had thrown them up
      above the water at the time that the island emerged.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>The colonists even visited dark tunnels...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      However, if these substructures appeared to be absolutely deserted, if
      the obscurity there was complete, Cyrus Smith was forced to acknowledge
      that absolute silence did not reign there.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the end of one of these dark cavities extending to a
      length of several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was
      surprised to hear muffled rumblings, increased in intensity by the
      resonance of the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, who was with him, also heard these distant murmurs, which
      indicated a revival of the subterranean fires. Several times they both
      heard it and they were in agreement on this point, that some chemical
      reaction was going on in the bowels of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The volcano then is not totally extinct?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/760.jpg" border="1" width="325" height="460" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b>“The volcano then is not totally extinct?”</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,” replied Cyrus
      Smith, “there has been some activity in the lower levels. Any volcano,
      although considered fully extinct, can evidently become active again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if Mount Franklin is getting ready for an eruption,” asked Gideon
      Spilett, “would it not pose a danger for Lincoln Island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not think so,” replied the engineer. “The crater, that is to say
      the safety valve, exists and the overflow of vapor and lava will escape
      as it formerly did by its accustomed outlet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Provided the lava does not blaze a new passage toward the fertile parts
      of the island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, my dear Spilett,” replied Cyrus Smith, “why would it not follow its
      natural route?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well! Volcanos are capricious!” replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Notice,” replied the engineer, “that the inclination of the entire mass
      of Mount Franklin favors the outpouring of material toward the valleys
      which we are exploring at this moment. It would need an earthquake which
      changed the center of gravity of the mountain to modify this outpouring.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But an earthquake is always to be feared under these conditions,” noted
      Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Always,” replied the engineer, “especially when the subterranean forces
      begin to awaken and the bowels of the earth have been obstructed after a
      long repose. Also, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing
      for us and it would be best if the volcano did not have the urge to
      awaken! But we can do nothing, can we? In any case, whatever comes, I do
      not think that our domain at Grand View will be seriously menaced.
      Between there and the mountain, the soil is noticeably depressed and if
      ever the lava takes a path toward the lake it will be thrown toward the
      dunes and the neighboring portions of Shark Gulf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We still have not seen any smoke at the top of the mountain which would
      indicate an approaching eruption,” said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Cyrus Smith, “no vapor is escaping from the crater. I
      observed the summit only yesterday. But it is possible that in the lower
      part of the chimney, time has accumulated rocks, cinders and hardened
      lava and that this valve, as I call it, is temporarily blocked. But at
      the first serious effort, all obstacles will disappear and you may be
      certain, my dear Spilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler,
      nor the volcano, which is the chimney, will crack under the pressure of
      the gas. Nevertheless, I repeat, it would be better if there were no
      eruption.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet we are not mistaken,” replied the reporter. “We can definitely
      hear muffled rumblings in the very bowels of the volcano!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact,” replied the engineer, who listened again carefully, “there is
      no mistaking... A reaction is going on there whose importance and final
      outcome we cannot evaluate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett left and returned to their companions who
      were told about the state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good” shouted Pencroff, “this volcano wants to do its thing! But if it
      tries, it will find its master!...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who?” asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our genie, Neb, our genie, who will gag the crater if it only hints at
      opening up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      One could see that the sailor’s confidence toward the special deity of
      his island was absolute and certainly the occult power, which had
      manifested itself up to that time by so many inexplicable acts, appeared
      to be without limits; but it also escaped the minute search conducted by
      the colonists, because in spite of their efforts, in spite of the zeal,
      more than the zeal, the tenacity with which they carried on their
      exploration, the strange retreat had not been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the 19th to the 25th of February, the circle of the investigation
      was extended to all of the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most
      secret retreats were searched. The colonists ended by sounding each rocky
      wall, as the police do to the walls of a suspicious house. The engineer
      even made a very exact survey of the mountain and carried his search down
      to the foundations which supported it. It was even explored to the top of
      the truncated cone which ended the first stage of rocks and then to the
      upper edge of this enormous hat, at the bottom of which the crater
      opened.

      They did more: they visited the still extinct abyss, but within its depth
      they could distinctly hear rumblings. However, there was no smoke, no
      vapor nor any heat from the walls to indicate an approaching eruption.
      But neither there nor at any other part of Mount Franklin could the
      colonists find any trace of the person they were looking for.

      The investigation was then directed toward all of the dunes region. They
      carefully examined the high lava walls of Shark Gulf, from top to bottom,
      even though it was extremely difficult to reach the level of the gulf.

      much stubbornness which produced no result and there was a sort of anger
      in the discomfort of Cyrus Smith and his companions.

      They therefore had to think of returning, because these searches could
      not be pursued indefinitely. The colonists were truly right in believing
      that the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island and
      then the craziest notions haunted their overexcited imaginations.
      Pencroff and Neb in particular, could no longer limit themselves to the
      world of unusual things, but let themselves be carried into the

      On the 25th of February, the colonists again entered Granite House and by
      means of a double cord brought to the landing of the door with an arrow,
      they re-established communication between their domain and the ground.

      third anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.
