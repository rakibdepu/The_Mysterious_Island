<p class="huge">
    <b class="cap">At</b> these words the reclining man lifted himself up and
    his face appeared in full light: a magnificent head, high forehead, fiery
    look, white beard, hair abundant and thrown back.
</p>
<p>
    This man supported himself with his hands against the back of the divan.
    He was calm. One could see that some lingering illness was undermining
    him little by little but his voice still seemed strong when he said in
    English and in a tone which expressed extreme surprise:
</p>
<p>
    “I have no name, sir.”
</p>
<p>
    “I know you,” replied Cyrus Smith.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo fixed an ardent gaze on the engineer as if he wished to
    annihilate him.
</p>
<p>
    Then he fell back on the pillows of the divan.
</p>
<p>
    “It doesn’t matter after all,” he murmured, “I am going to die!”
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith approached Captain Nemo and Gideon Spilett took his hand,
    which he found to be burning. Ayrton, Pencroff, Herbert and Neb
    respectfully stood to one side in a corner of this magnificent salon
    whose air was saturated with electrical radiation.
</p>
<p>
    However Captain Nemo immediately removed his hand and with a sign he
    begged the engineer and the reporter to be seated.
</p>
<p>
    All looked at him with true emotion. Here was the person they called the
    “genie of the island”, the powerful being whose intervention under so
    many circumstances had been so effective, this benefactor to whom they
    were so much indebted. Before their eyes there was only a man where
    Pencroff and Neb thought they would find a near god and this man was
    ready to die.
</p>
<p>
    But how was it that Cyrus Smith knew Captain Nemo? Why had the latter
    gotten up so vividly on hearing this name pronounced which he thought the
    world was ignorant of?...
</p>
<p>
    The captain resumed his place on the divan and, supported by his arms, he
    looked at the engineer seated next to him.
</p>
<p>
    “You know the name which I had, sir?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
    “I know it,” replied Cyrus Smith, “just as I know the name of this
    admirable submarine apparatus.”
</p>
<p>
    “The <i>Nautilus</i>?” said the captain, half smiling.
</p>
<p>
    “The <i>Nautilus</i>.”
</p>
<p>
    “But do you know... do you know who I am?”
</p>
<p>
    “I know that.”
</p>
<p>
    “Nevertheless it has been thirty years since I have had any communication
    with the inhabited world, thirty years during which I lived in the depths
    of the sea, the only place where I found independence! Who then could
    have betrayed my secret?”
</p>
<p>
    “A man who never pledged loyalty to you, Captain Nemo, and who
    consequently cannot be accused of treason.”
</p>
<p>
    “The Frenchman who was cast on board by chance sixteen years ago?”
</p>
<p>
    “The same.”
</p>
<p>
    “This man and his companions then did not perish in the maelstrom in
    which the <i>Nautilus</i> was entangled?”
</p>
<p>
    “They did not perish and a book has appeared under the title of ‘Twenty
    Thousand Leagues Under the Sea’ which contains your story.”
</p>
<p>
    “The story of a few months only, sir!” replied the captain vividly.
</p>
<p>
    “It is true,” replied Cyrus Smith, “but several months of this strange
    life have sufficed to make you known...”
</p>
<p>
    “As a master criminal doubtless?” replied Captain Nemo, allowing a
    haughty smile to pass his lips. “Yes, a rebel, banned perhaps by
    humanity!”
</p>
<p>
    The engineer did not reply.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, sir?”
</p>
<p>
    “I have not judged Captain Nemo,” replied Cyrus Smith, “at least as it
    concerns his past life. I am ignorant, as is all the world, of what have
    been the motives for this strange existence and I cannot judge the
    effects without knowing the causes; but this much I know, that a helping
    hand has always been extended to us since our arrival on Lincoln Island.
    We all owe our lives to a good, generous, powerful being and this
    powerful, generous, good being is you, Captain Nemo!”
</p>
<p>
    The captain simply replied, “It is I.”
</p>
<p>
    The engineer and the reporter got up. Their companions approached and the
    gratitude which was overflowing from their hearts was translated by
    gestures, by words...
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo stopped them with a sign and with a voice doubtless more
    emotional than he had intended:
</p>
<p>
    “Wait until you have heard me,” he said.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    And the captain, in a few clear and urgent sentences, made his entire
    life known.
</p>
<p>
    His story was brief and yet he had to concentrate all his remaining
    energy to say it. It was evident that he was battling against an extreme
    weakness. Several times Cyrus Smith suggested that he take some rest but
    he shook his head, like a man who has no tomorrow, and when the reporter
    offered him some attention:
</p>
<p>
    “It is useless,” he said, “my hours are numbered.”
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo was an Indian, Prince Dakkar, the son of a rajah of the then
    independent territory of Bundelkund and a nephew of the Indian hero,
    Tippu-Sahib. His father sent him to Europe when he was ten years old in
    order that he receive a complete education with the secret intention that
    he would fight one day with equal arms against those whom he considered
    to be the oppressors of his country.
</p>
<p>
    From the ages of ten to thirty, Prince Dakkar, who was superiorly endowed
    and of a noble heart and spirit, pursued his studies far and wide in all
    things, including the sciences, the letters and the arts.
</p>
<p>
    Prince Dakkar travelled throughout Europe. His noble birth and his
    fortune made him sought after but the temptations of the world never had
    any attraction for him. Young and handsome, he remained serious, gloomy,
    ravenous in his thirst for knowledge, and having an implacable resentment
    riveted to his heart.
</p>
<p>
    Prince Dakkar hated. He hated the only country where he never wished to
    set foot, the only nation whose overtures he constantly refused: he hated
    England and the more so because up to a point he admired it.
</p>
<p>
    So it was that this Indian typified in himself all the fierce hatred of
    the vanquished against the conqueror. The invader would not find mercy in
    the invaded land. The son of one of those sovereigns from whom the United
    Kingdom could only expect nominal obedience, this prince from the family
    of Tippu-Sahib, raised on the ideas of vindication and of vengeance,
    having an irresistible love for his poetic country burdened by English
    chains, never wanted to set foot on this cursed land to which India owed
    its enslavement.
</p>
<p>
    Prince Dakkar became an artist nobly impressed with the marvels of art, a
    scientist who was no stranger to advanced science, a statesman trained
    amongst European courts. To those who observed him casually he passed
    perhaps as one of those cosmopolitans, curious about knowledge, but
    scorning action, one of those opulent travellers with a fiery and
    platonic spirit who move about the world incessantly and are of no
    country.
</p>
<p>
    This was not the case. This artist, this scientist, this man had remained
    Indian in his heart, Indian by his desire for vengeance, Indian by his
    hope of one day reclaiming the rights of his country by driving out the
    foreigner and restoring its independence.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He
    married a noble Indian woman whose heart bled as his did at her country’s
    misfortunes. He had two children whom he cherished. But his domestic
    happiness could not make him forget India’s enslavement. He waited for an
    occasion. It presented itself.
</p>
<p>
    The English yoke weighed heavily on the Hindu population. Prince Dakkar
    became the spokesman for the malcontents. He instilled them with all the
    hatred which he felt against the foreigner. He scoured not only the still
    independent areas on the Indian Peninsula but also the regions directly
    subject to English administration. He remembered the great days of
    Tippu-Sahib who died heroically at Seringapatam in the defense of his
    country.
</p>
<p>
    In 1857, the great Sepoy revolt erupted. Prince Dakkar was its soul. He
    organized the immense upheaval. He put his talents and his riches to the
    service of this cause. He sacrificed himself. He fought in the front
    lines, he risked his life like the humblest of those heros who had risen
    up to free their country; he was wounded ten times in twenty encounters
    but could not find death when the last soldiers of the fight for
    independence fell under English bullets.
</p>
<p>
    Never had the English power in India been subject to such danger, and if,
    as they had hoped, the Sepoys had received help from the outside, it
    would perhaps have altered the influence and domination of the United
    Kingdom in Asia.
</p>
<p>
    The name of Prince Dakkar was then illustrious. The heroes who supported
    him did not hide but fought openly. A price was put on his head and if he
    had not encountered a traitor to whom he entrusted his father, his
    mother, his wife and his children who would suffer before he realized the
    dangers he had caused them to undergo...
</p>
<p>
    This time again, might made right. But civilization never goes backward
    and it seems to follow a necessary course. The Sepoys were vanquished and
    the land of the ancient rajahs again fell under the stricter domination
    of England.
</p>
<p>
    Prince Dakkar, who could not find death, returned to the mountains of
    Bundelkund. There, henceforth alone, he was filled with disgust against
    all who carried the name of man, having a hatred and a horror of the
    civilized world and wanting to flee from it forever. He gathered the
    remains of his fortune, united with about twenty of his most trustworthy
    companions and one day they all disappeared.
</p>
<p>
    Where then had Prince Dakkar gone to find this independence which the
    inhabited world refused him? Under the water, in the depths of the sea,
    where none could follow him.
</p>
<p>
    The man of war became the scientist. On a deserted island in the Pacific
    he built a shipyard and there a submarine vessel was constructed based on
    his plans. By means which will one day be known, he used the incomparable
    force of electricity, which he drew from inexhaustible sources, for all
    the necessities of his floating apparatus, for movement, for lighting,
    and for heating. The sea, with its infinite treasures, its myriads of
    fish, its harvest of seaweed and sargassum, its enormous mammals, and not
    only everything put there by nature but also everything that mankind had
    lost there, would suffice amply for the needs of the prince and his crew.
    This was the accomplishment of his most vivid desire since he no longer
    wished to have any communication with the world. He named his submarine
    apparatus the <i>Nautilus</i>, he called himself Captain Nemo, and he
    disappeared beneath the seas.
</p>
<p>
    For many years the captain visited all the oceans from one pole to the
    other. An outcast from the inhabited world, he gathered up admirable
    treasures from unknown worlds. The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo in
    1702 by the Spanish galleons furnished him with an inexhaustible mine of
    riches which he always disposed anonymously in favor of those people who
    fought for the independence of their country.<sup><a href=
                                                                 "#n2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    He was for a long time without any communication with his fellow beings
    when three men were thrown on board during the night of the 6th of
    November 1866. They were a French professor, his servant and a Canadian
    fisherman. These three men had been cast into the sea during a collision
    between the <i>Nautilus</i> and the United States frigate, the <i>Abraham
    Lincoln</i>, which was chasing it.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo learned from the professor that the <i>Nautilus</i>,
    sometimes taken as a giant mammal of the cetacean family, sometimes for a
    submarine apparatus containing a crew of pirates, was being pursued
    across all the seas.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo could have thrown back into the ocean these three men that
    chance had thrown across the path of his mysterious existence. He did not
    do that but kept them as prisoners and for seven months they were able to
    contemplate all the marvels of a voyage which covered twenty thousand
    leagues under the seas.
</p>
<p>
    One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of
    Captain Nemo’s past, succeeded in escaping after having gotten hold of
    the <i>Nautilus</i>’ boat. But since at that moment the <i>Nautilus</i>
    was trapped in a whirling maelstrom off the Norwegian coast, the captain
    assumed that the fugitives had drowned in the frightful eddy, finding
    death at the bottom of the whirlpool. He was ignorant then that the
    Frenchman and his two companions had been miraculously thrown on shore,
    that fishermen from the Lofoten Islands had saved them and that the
    professor, on his return to France, had published a book relating the
    seven months of this strange and adventurous journey of the
    <i>Nautilus</i>, indulging the public’s curiosity.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo still continued to live this way for a long time, following
    the seas. But little by little his companions died and went to their rest
    in their coral cemetery at the bottom of the Pacific. The <i>Nautilus</i>
    became empty and finally Captain Nemo alone remained of all those who had
    taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo was then sixty years old. Alone he succeeded in bringing his
    <i>Nautilus</i> to one of the submarine ports which he used at times.
</p>
<p>
    One of these ports was hollowed out under Lincoln Island and it was this
    one which was now giving asylum to the <i>Nautilus</i>.
</p>
<p>
    For six years the captain remained there, no longer navigating, awaiting
    death, that is to say the moment when he would be reunited with his
    companions when by chance he was present at the collapse of the balloon
    which was carrying the Southern prisoners. Putting on his diving suit, he
    walked under the water a few cables from shore when the engineer was
    thrown into the sea. On a generous impulse, the captain saved Cyrus
    Smith.
</p>
<p>
    At first he wanted to run from these five castaways but his port of
    refuge was closed and as a consequence of a movement of the basalt
    produced by volcanic action, he could no longer pass through the entrance
    to the crypt. There was still enough water for a small boat to pass but
    no longer enough for the <i>Nautilus</i> which had a considerable
    displacement.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo therefore remained to observe these men, thrown without
    resources on a deserted island but he did not wish to be seen. Little by
    little, as he saw their honesty, energy and their fraternal devotion to
    one another, he became interested in their efforts. In spite of himself,
    he learned all the secrets of their existence. By means of the diving
    suit it was easy for him to reach the bottom of the inside well of
    Granite House and climb up to the upper opening, using the projections in
    the rock. He overheard the colonists telling about their past and
    discussing the present and the future. From them he learned of the
    immense effort to abolish slavery with American fighting American. Yes!
    These were men worthy of Captain Nemo’s reconciliation with the well
    represented humanity on the island.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Smith. It was also he who brought the dog to
    the Chimneys, who threw Top out of the waters of the lake, who stranded
    at Flotsom Point this case which contained so many things useful to the
    colonists, who put the canoe back into the Mercy’s current, who threw
    down the cord from the top of Granite House when the apes attacked it,
    who made Ayrton’s presence on Tabor Island known by means of the document
    enclosed in the bottle, who capsized the brig with the explosion of a
    torpedo placed at the bottom of the channel, who saved Herbert from a
    certain death by bringing the sulphate of quinine and finally who killed
    the convicts with these secret electrical bullets which he used for
    submarine hunting. This then explained these many incidents which seemed
    supernatural, all of which attested to the generosity and the power of
    the captain.
</p>
<p>
    However, the noble misanthrope still yearned to do good. There remained
    some useful information for him to impart to his proteges and in
    addition, with death approaching, he yielded to the dictates of his heart
    and summoned the colonists of Granite House, as we know, by means of the
    wire linking the corral to the <i>Nautilus</i> which had an alphabetical
    apparatus... Perhaps he would not have done it if he had known that Cyrus
    Smith knew enough of his history to address him by the name of Nemo.
</p>
<p>
    The captain ended the story of his life. Cyrus Smith then spoke; he
    recalled all the incidents which had exerted such beneficial influences
    on the colony and in the name of his companions as well as himself, he
    thanked the generous being to whom they owed so much.
</p>
<p>
    But Captain Nemo had no thought of putting a price on the services which
    he had rendered. One last thought was on his mind and before shaking the
    hand that the engineer presented to him:
</p>
<p>
    “Now, sir,” he said, “now that you know my life, what is your judgement?”
</p>
<p>
    In so speaking the captain was evidently alluding to a serious incident
    which had been witnessed by the three strangers thrown on board—an
    incident which the French professor had necessarily related in his book.
    The memory of it was terrible.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, a few days before the professor and his two companions escaped,
    the <i>Nautilus</i>, being pursued by a frigate in the North Atlantic,
    had rushed against it like a battering ram and sunk it without mercy.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith understood the illusion and remained silent.
</p>
<p>
    “It was an English frigate, sir,” Captain Nemo shouted, again becoming
    Prince Dakkar for a moment, “an English frigate, do you hear me? It
    attacked me! I was restricted to a narrow shallow bay... I had to pass,
    and... I passed. ”
</p>
<p>
    Then, in a calmer voice:
</p>
<p>
    “I had justice and right on my side,” he added. “I always showed mercy
    when I could but did harm when I had to. In all fairness, isn’t that
    pardonable?”
</p>
<p>
    A few moments of silence followed this response and Captain Nemo again
    asked:
</p>
<p>
    “What do you think of me, gentlemen?”
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith held out his hand to the captain and, as requested, he
    replied in a solemn voice:
</p>
<p>
    “Captain, your error was in believing that you could bring back the past
    and you have opposed necessary progress. It was one of those errors that
    some admire and others blame but which God alone can judge and which
    rational mankind must forgive. We may oppose someone who is mistaken in
    his good intentions, but we should not cease to esteem him. Your error is
    not one of those that excludes admiration and your name has nothing to
    fear from the judgement of history. History loves heroic madness while
    condemning its consequences.”
</p>
<p>
    Captain Nemo’s chest heaved and he pointed to heaven.
</p>
<p>
    “Was I wrong, was I right?” he murmured.
</p>

    <img alt="“Was I wrong, was I right?...”" src="images/809.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>“Was I wrong, was I right?...”</p>
</pic>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith replied:
</p>
<p>
    “All great deeds return to God from whence they came! The honest men
    here, whom you have saved, will always mourn you, Captain Nemo!”
</p>
<p>
    Herbert approached the captain. He bent his knees, took his hand and
    knelt.
</p>
<p>
    A tear glistened from the eyes of the dying man.
</p>
<p>
    “My child,” he said, “bless you!...”
