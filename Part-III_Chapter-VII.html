      <b class="cap">At</b> Herbert’s cry, Pencroff dropped his weapon and ran
      toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They have killed him !” he shouted. “He, my child. They have killed
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett ran toward Herbert. The reporter tried to
      hear if the poor child’s heart was still beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He lives,” he said, “but he must be carried...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To Granite House? That is impossible,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the corral then!” shouted Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One moment,” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he ran to the left to get around the corner of the enclosure. There
      he saw a convict who, aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. A few
      seconds later, before he even had time to fire his second round, he fell,
      struck in the heart by Cyrus Smith’s dagger, still more reliable than his
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor raised themselves up the
      corners of the palisade, went over the top, removed the stays which shut
      the inner door, ran to the house which was empty, and soon poor Herbert
      was lying on Ayrton’s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moment’s later, Cyrus Smith was by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing Herbert unconscious, the sailor’s pain was terrible. He sobbed,
      he cried, he wanted to knock his head against the wall. Neither the
      engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They themselves were
      suffocating with emotion. They could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless it was dependent on them to save this poor child who was
      dying under their eyes. Gideon Spilett, whose life was strewn with
      incidents such as these, was not without some practical knowledge about
      current medicine. He knew a little about everything and he had already
      encountered many a circumstance in which he had been called upon to
      attend to wounds produced either by bare arms or by firearms. Assisted by
      Cyrus Smith, he therefore proceeded to give the attention required by
      Herbert’s condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, the reporter was struck by the general stupor which
      overwhelmed him, a stupor which was due either to hemorrhage or even to
      shock, if the bullet struck a bone with sufficient force to cause a
      violent reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was extremely pale and his pulse was so weak that Gideon Spilett
      felt it beat only at long intervals, as if it had been on the point of
      stopping. During this time, he came to a nearly complete conclusion based
      on his instinct and knowledge. These symptoms were very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert’s chest was bared and, inasmuch as the bleeding had stopped with
      the aid of handkerchiefs, his chest was washed with cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contusion, or rather the wound, became visible. An oval hole existed
      in his chest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there that the
      bullet had struck Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor child over. He
      groaned so weakly that they thought it was his last sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wound had bloodied Herbert’s back and the bullet which had struck
      Herbert had directly exited.
    </p>
    <p>
      “God be praised!” said the reporter, “the bullet did not remain in the
      body and we will not have to extract it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the heart?...” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The heart has not been touched, otherwise Herbert would be dead!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dead!” shouted Pencroff, with a roar!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor had only heard the reporter’s last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Pencroff,” replied Cyrus Smith, “no! He is not dead. His pulse still
      beats. He has even uttered a sigh. But in the interests of your child,
      calm yourself. We have need of all our composure. Let us not lose it, my
      friend.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff was silent but a reaction set in and large tears covered his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Gideon Spilett tried to recall what he knew and to proceed
      methodically. From what he could see, there was no doubt that the bullet
      had entered from the front and left at the rear. What ravages had this
      bullet caused in its passage? What vital organs had it reached? A
      professional surgeon could hardly say at the moment, nor with better
      reason could the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he knew one thing: it was that he would have to prevent the
      inflammatory restriction of the injured parts, and then deal with the
      local inflammation and the fever which would result from this wound, a
      mortal wound perhaps. Now what topical medications, what antiphlogistics
      should be used? By what means could he reduce this inflammation?
    </p>
    <p>
      In any event, one thing was important, it was that the two wounds should
      be dressed without delay. It did not seem necessary to Gideon Spilett to
      bring on a new flow of blood by washing the wounds in lukewarm water and
      by compressing the lips. The hemorrhage had been very abundant and
      Herbert was very weak from the loss of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter therefore felt that he must be content with washing the two
      wounds in cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was placed on his left side and kept in that position.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not necessary for him to move,” said Gideon Spilett. “He is in the
      best position for his back and chest wounds to suppurate easily, and rest
      is absolutely necessary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What! Can’t we carry him to Granite House?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Pencroff,” replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Curses,” shouted the sailor, with his fist turned toward the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pencroff!” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett again examined the wounded child carefully. Herbert was so
      frightfully pale that the reporter was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cyrus,” he said, “I am not a doctor... I am terribly perplexed... You
      must help me with your advice and your experience...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep your calm..., my friend,” replied the engineer, seizing the
      reporter’s hand. “Judge coolly... Think only of this: Herbert must be
      saved!”
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Gideon Spilett regained possession of himself, which he
      had lost in a moment of discouragement. He sat down beside the bed. Cyrus
      Smith remained standing. Pencroff tore his shirt and was mechanically
      making bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett then explained to Cyrus Smith that he felt that, before
      anything else, he must stop the hemorrhage, but not to close the two
      wounds, nor to encourage their immediate cicatrization, because he had
      had an interior perforation and he must not let the pus accumulate in the
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith approved completely and it was decided that they would dress
      the two wounds without trying to close them with immediate coaptation.
      Very fortunately, it did not seem that an incision was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, did the colonists possess any effective agent to react against
      the inflammation which would follow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! They had one, because nature had generously provided it. They had
      cold water, that is to say the most powerful sedative that can be used
      against the inflammation of wounds, the most effective therapeutic agent
      in these serious cases and which is now used by all doctors. Moreover,
      cold water has the advantage of leaving the wound at absolute rest and to
      protect it from any premature dressing, a considerable advantage, since
      it has been demonstrated by experience that contact with air is
      disastrous during the first few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett and Cyrus Smith reasoned thus with their simple good sense
      and they acted as the best surgeon would have. Cloth compresses were
      applied to poor Herbert’s two wounds and they were constantly soaked in
      cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor had, from the first, lit a fire in the fireplace of the
      dwelling which did not lack the things necessary for life. Some maple
      sugar and medicinal herbs—the very ones that the lad had gathered on the
      banks of Lake Grant—allowed them to make some refreshing drinks and they
      made him take it without his being aware of it. His fever was extremely
      high and the entire day and night passed without his regaining
      consciousness. Herbert’s life hung by a thread and that thread could
      break at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 12th of November, Cyrus Smith and his companions
      recovered some hope. Herbert came out of his long stupor. He opened his
      eyes and recognized Cyrus Smith, the reporter and Pencroff. He said two
      or three words. He knew nothing of what had happened. They told him and
      Gideon Spilett asked him to remain absolutely at rest, telling him that
      his life was not in danger and that his wounds would cicatrize in a few
      days. Besides, Herbert did not suffer nearly as much and this cold water,
      which was sprinkled on continually, prevented any inflammation of the
      wounds. The suppuration established itself in a regular way, the fever
      did not go higher and they could hope that this terrible wound would not
      become a catastrophe. Pencroff felt his heart inflate little by little.
      He was like a sister of charity, like a mother at the bed of her child.
    </p>

      <b>Hebert opened his eyes.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      Herbert became drowsy again but his sleep seemed to be better.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me again that you are hopeful, Mister Spilett!” said Pencroff.
      “Tell me again that you will save Herbert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, we will save him!” replied the reporter. “The wound is serious and
      perhaps the bullet has even gone through the lung but the perforation of
      this organ is not fatal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “God has heard you,” repeated Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one can well imagine, during the twenty four hours that they were at
      the corral, the colonists had no other thought than to care for Herbert.
      They did not concern themselves either with the danger which could menace
      them if the convicts returned or with precautions to take for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this day, while Pencroff watched at the bed of the patient, Cyrus
      Smith and the reporter spoke to each other about what it would be best to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, they ran through the corral. There was no trace of Ayrton.
      Had the unfortunate been dragged away by his former accomplices? Had they
      surprised him in the corral? Had he fought back and succumbed in battle?
      This last hypothesis was only too likely. When Gideon Spilett had scaled
      the palisade enclosure, he perfectly saw one of the convicts fleeing from
      Top by the southern buttress of Mount Franklin. He was among those whose
      boat had broken up on the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy. Moreover, the
      one that Cyrus Smith had killed, and whose body was found outside the
      enclosure, certainly belonged to Bob Harvey’s gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the corral, it had not been subjected to any devastation. The doors
      being closed, the domestic animals had not been able to disperse into the
      forest. They no longer saw any trace of a battle, nor any damage either
      in the dwelling or at the palisade. Only the munitions with which Ayrton
      had been provided had disappeared with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The unlucky fellow had been surprised,” said Cyrus Smith, “and since he
      was a man to defend himself, he succumbed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! That is to be feared,” replied the reporter. “Then doubtless, the
      convicts installed themselves at the corral where they found everything
      in abundance and they took to flight when they saw us coming. It is also
      quite evident that at this moment Ayrton, dead or alive, is no longer
      here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We must search the forest,” said the engineer, “and rid the island of
      these scoundrels. Pencroff was not mistaken in his forebodings when he
      wanted us to hunt them like wild beasts. That would certainly have spared
      us these misfortunes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the reporter, “but now we have the right to act without
      pity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In any case,” said the engineer, “we are forced to wait and to remain at
      the corral until such time as we can carry Herbert to Granite House
      without danger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Neb?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Neb is secure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if, uneasy at our absence, he risks coming?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He must not come!” replied Cyrus Smith vividly. “He will be assassinated
      en route!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is very likely that he will try to join us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! If the telegraph were still working, we could warn him. But now that
      is impossible. As to letting Pencroff and Herbert stay here alone, we
      cannot do that!... Oh well, I will go to Granite House alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no! Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “you must not expose yourself!
      Your courage will accomplish nothing. These wretches are evidently
      watching the corral, they are lying in wait in the thick woods which
      surround it and if you leave, we will soon have two misfortunes to regret
      instead of one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Neb?” repeated the engineer. “It is twenty four hours since he has
      had any news from us. He will want to come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And since he will be less on his guard than we ourselves would be,”
      replied Gideon Spilett, “he will be struck down...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Isn’t there any way to prevent it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      While the engineer was thinking, his attention fell on Top who, by his
      going to and fro, seemed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Am I not here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Top!” shouted Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal rushed forward at his master’s call.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Top will go,” said the reporter, who understood the engineer. “Top
      can go where we cannot go. He will carry news from the corral to Granite
      House and he will bring it back to us from Granite House.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quickly!” replied Cyrus Smith. “Quickly!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett rapidly tore out a page from his notebook and he wrote
      these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave
      Granite House. Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood? Reply by
      Top.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This laconic note contained all Neb had to know and at the same time
      asked him all that the colonists had an interest in knowing. It was
      folded and attached to Top’s collar so as to be plainly visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Top! my dog,” the engineer then said, caressing the animal. “Neb, Top!
      Neb! Go! go!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Top dashed forward at these words. He understood what was required of
      him. He was familiar with the road to the corral. In less than a
      half-hour, he could make this trip which neither Cyrus Smith nor the
      reporter could chance without danger. Top, running among the tall grass
      or at the edge of the wood, would pass unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer went to the doors of the corral and opened one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Neb! Top, Neb,” the engineer repeated once more, extending his hand in
      the direction of Granite House.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/691.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>“Neb! Top, Neb,” repeated the engineer.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      Top dashed out and disappeared almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He will get there!” said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and the faithful animal will return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What time is it?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ten o’clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In an hour he will be here perhaps. Let us be on the lookout for his
      return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the corral was closed again. The engineer and the reporter
      returned to the house. Herbert was then in a deep stupor. Pencroff
      continually kept his compresses wet. Gideon Spilett, seeing that he had
      nothing to do at the moment, occupied himself with preparing some
      nourishment, all the while carefully watching that part of the enclosure
      facing the buttress, from which an attack could come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists waited for Top’s return not without anxiety. A little after
      eleven o’clock, Cyrus Smith and the reporter, with carbine in hand, were
      behind the door ready to open it at the first bark from their dog. They
      had no doubt that if Top had fortunately been able to arrive at Granite
      House, Neb would immediately send him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both there for about ten minutes when a detonation was heard
      which was soon followed by repeated barking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer opened the door and, seeing the remains of smoke a hundred
      feet into the woods, he fired in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately Top rushed into the corral whose door was quickly
      closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Top, Top!” shouted the engineer, taking the fine large head of the dog
      into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A note was attached to his neck and Cyrus Smith read these words, written
      out in Neb’s large handwriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No pirates in the neighborhood of Granite House. I will not stir. Poor
      Mister Herbert.”
