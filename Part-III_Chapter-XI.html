      <b class="cap">Gideon Spilett</b> took the box and opened it. It
      contained about two hundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of
      which he carried to his lips. The extreme bitterness of this substance
      could not be mistaken. It certainly was the precious alkaloid of Peruvian
      bark, the pre-eminent anti-periodic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to administer this powder to Herbert without hesitating. How it
      got there, they would discuss later.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Some coffee,” said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Neb brought over a lukewarm cup of the infusion.
      Gideon Spilett threw in about eighteen grains<sup><a href=
      "#n1">1</a></sup> of quinine and they succeeded in making Herbert drink
      the mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still time because the third attack of the pernicious fever had
      not manifested itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it may be added, that it must not return!
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, it is necessary to say, everyone had recovered hope. The
      mysterious influence had been exercised anew and in a supreme moment,
      when they had despaired of it!...
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few hours Herbert was resting peacefully. The colonists could
      then discuss this incident. The intervention of the stranger was more
      evident than ever. But how had he been able to get into Granite House
      during the night? It was absolutely inexplicable and in truth, the means
      used by the “genie of the island” were no less strange than the genie
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this day, the sulphate of quinine was administered to Herbert
      about every three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Herbert experienced a certain improvement. He had not yet
      recovered and intermittent fevers are subject to frequent and dangerous
      recurrences but he had no lack of care. And then the specific was there
      and not far doubtless, was he who brought it! In short, an immense hope
      returned to everyone’s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hope was not unjustified. Ten days later, on the 20th of December,
      Herbert began his convalescence. He was still weak and a severe diet had
      been imposed on him but there had been no further attack. And then the
      docile child voluntarily submitted to all the prescriptions which were
      imposed on him. He yearned to get better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff was like a man who had been snatched from the bottom of an
      abyss. He had crises of joy which bordered on delirium. After the time
      for the third attack had passed, he seized the reporter in his arms and
      smothered him. From then on he only called him Doctor Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained to discover the real doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will find him,” repeated the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And certainly the man, whoever he was, could expect a somewhat rugged
      embrace from worthy Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of December ended and with it this year of 1867 during which
      the colonists of Lincoln Island had been so sorely tried. They began the
      year 1868 with magnificent weather, superb warmth and a tropical
      temperature which fortunately was cooled by sea breezes. Herbert revived,
      and from his bed, placed near one of the Granite House windows, he
      inhaled the wholesome salty air which restored his health. He began to
      eat and God knows what dainty dishes, frivolous and savory, Neb prepared
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is enough to make one wish for an illness,” said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all of this time the convicts had not once shown themselves in the
      vicinity of Granite House. Of Ayrton there was no news and if the
      engineer and Herbert still had any hope of finding him again, their
      companions did not doubt that the unfortunate had succumbed. However
      these uncertainties could not continue and as soon as the lad would be
      able bodied, the expedition whose result was so important, would be
      undertaken. But they would have to wait a month perhaps, because it would
      take all the forces of the colony to get the upper hand over the
      convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, Herbert was getting better and better. The congestion of the
      liver had disappeared and the wounds could be considered as definitely
      cicatrized.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the month of January, important work was done at Grand View
      Plateau; but it consisted only in saving what they could of the
      devastated harvests of corn and vegetables. The seeds and plants were
      gathered so as to furnish a new harvest for the coming half-season. As to
      rebuilding the poultry yard, the mill and the stables, Cyrus Smith
      preferred to wait. While his companions and he would be in pursuit of the
      convicts, the latter could well pay a new visit to the plateau and would
      not fail to give rein to their profession as pillagers and arsonists.
      They would see about rebuilding when they had purged the island of these
      scoundrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young convalescent began to get up during the second fortnight of the
      month of January, first an hour each day, then two, then three. His
      strength returned visibly, so vigorous was his constitution. He was then
      eighteen years old. He was tall and promised to become a noble man with a
      commanding presence. From this time on his convalescence, though still
      requiring care—and Doctor Spilett showed himself to be very
      strict—proceeded on schedule.
    </p>

      <b>The young convalescent began to get up.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      Toward the end of the month, Herbert had already been to Grand View
      Plateau and the beach. A few sea baths taken in the company of Pencroff
      and Neb did him a world of good. Cyrus Smith felt he could already set
      the day of departure which was fixed for the 15th of February. The
      nights, which were very clear at this time of the year, would favor the
      search that they would make of the entire island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparations for this exploration were therefore begun and they had
      to be considerable because the colonists had sworn that they would not
      enter Granite House again until their double purpose had been attained:
      on the one hand, to destroy the convicts and find Ayrton again if he was
      still alive; on the other, to discover who presided so effectively over
      the destinies of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Lincoln Island, the colonists were well acquainted with all of the
      eastern shore from Cape Claw to the Mandible Capes, the vast Tadorns
      marsh, the neighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Woods between the corral
      and the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and finally the
      buttresses of Mount Franklin, where they had established the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had explored, but only in an imperfect way, the vast coastline of
      Washington Bay from Cape Claw to Reptile Promontory, the forested and
      marshy west coast and those endless dunes which ended at the mouth of
      Shark’s Gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they knew nothing of the large wooded portions which covered
      Serpentine Peninsula, all of the right bank of the Mercy, the left bank
      of Falls River, and the network of these buttresses and these
      entrenchments which supported three quarters of the base of Mount
      Franklin in the west, the north and the east, there where so many
      retreats doubtless existed. Consequently several thousand acres of the
      island had still escaped their investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it was decided that the expedition would be carried across the Far
      West so as to include all of the part situated on the right bank of the
      Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it would be best to go first to the corral where they had reason
      to believe that the convicts had found refuge again either to pillage it
      or to install themselves there. But either the devastation of the corral
      was an accomplished fact by now and it was too late to prevent it, or the
      convicts had entrenched themselves there and there would always be time
      to go and dislodge them from their retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, after discussion, they held to the original plan, and the colonists
      resolved to reach Reptile Promontory by going through the woods. They
      could blaze a trail with the ax and thus beat the first path over a route
      which would put Granite House in communication with the extremity of the
      peninsula over a length of sixteen to seventeen miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart was in perfect condition. The onagers, being well rested, could
      make a long trip. Provisions, camping equipment, a portable stove and
      various utensils were loaded into the cart as well as arms and munitions
      chosen with care from the now complete Granite House arsenal. But they
      must not forget that the convicts were perhaps roaming the woods and that
      in these thick forests a gun could quickly be fired and reach its mark.
      Out there it would be necessary for the small troop of colonists to stay
      together and not separate for any reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also decided that no one would remain at Granite House. Top and
      Jup themselves would take part in the expedition. The inaccessible
      dwelling could guard itself all alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 14th of February, the day before the departure, was a Sunday. It was
      devoted entirely to rest and sanctified by thanks addressed to the
      Creator. Herbert, entirely recovered but still a bit weak, would have a
      place reserved for him in the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Smith took the measures necessary to protect
      Granite House against any invasion. The ladders which were formerly used
      for climbing up, were brought to the Chimneys and buried deep in the sand
      so that they could be used on their return because the drum of the
      elevator was dismantled and nothing remained of the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff stayed to the last in Granite House to finish this work and he
      lowered himself by means of a double cord held firmly from below and
      which once thrown to the ground would allow no communication between the
      upper landing and the beach.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/729.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>Pencroff lowered himself by means of a cord.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      The weather was magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It will be a warm day,” said the reporter joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah, Doctor Spilett,” replied Pencroff, “we will move along sheltered by
      the trees and we will not even see the sun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go!” said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart was waiting on the beach in front of the Chimneys. The reporter
      saw to it that Herbert took his place there, at least during the early
      hours of the trip, and the lad yielded to his doctor’s prescriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb put himself at the head on the onagers. Cyrus Smith, the reporter and
      the sailor were in front. Top frisked about joyously. Herbert had offered
      a place to Jup in his vehicle and Jup accepted without formality. The
      moment for departure had arrived and the small troop took to the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart first turned the corner at the river’s mouth then, after having
      ascended the left bank of the Mercy for a mile, it crossed the bridge at
      the end of which the route to Port Balloon began. There the explorers
      left the route on their left and plunged into the cover of these immense
      woods which formed the region of the Far West.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first two miles the well spaced trees allowed the cart to move
      freely; from time to time they had to chop away at creepers and brushwood
      but no serious obstacle opposed the passage of the colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thick branches kept the ground in the cool shade. Deodars, douglas,
      casuarinas, banksias, gum and dragon trees and other already discovered
      species succeeded each other as far as the eye could see. All the species
      of birds usual to the island were found there, grouse, jacamars,
      pheasant, lories and the entire babbling family of cockatoos, parakeets
      and parrots. Agouti, kangaroo and capybara ran about the grass, all of
      which reminded the colonists of the first excursions which were made upon
      their arrival on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless,” noted Cyrus Smith, “I notice that these animals,
      quadrupeds and birds, are more fearful than formerly. These woods have
      been recently scoured by the convicts who must certainly have left
      traces.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, in many places they recognized the more or less recent
      passage of a troop of men: here, cuts made on trees, perhaps to mark out
      the road: there, some cinders from an extinguished fire and some
      footprints preserved on clay ground. But, in short, nothing seemed to
      indicate a permanent encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer had suggested to his companions that they refrain from
      hunting. The noise from the firearms would warn the convicts who were
      perhaps roaming about the forest. Besides, the hunters would necessarily
      drift away from the cart and they were severely forbidden to wander
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the second part of the day, about six miles from Granite House,
      movement became rather difficult. In order to pass certain thickets, they
      had to chop down some trees to make a road. Before doing that, Cyrus
      Smith took care to send Top and Jup into the thick underbrush. They
      accomplished their task conscientiously and when the dog and the orang
      returned without giving any signal, they knew that there was nothing to
      fear, neither from the convicts nor from the wild beasts—two sorts of
      individuals of the genus animal whose ferocious instincts put them on the
      same level.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night of this first day, the colonists camped about nine miles
      from Granite House on the banks of a small tributary of the Mercy whose
      existence they were ignorant of. This was a part of the hydrographic
      system which gave the soil its astonishing fertility.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ate heartily because the colonists had a very sharp appetite and
      measures were taken to pass the night without disturbance. If the
      engineer had had to deal only with ferocious animals, jaguars or others,
      he would simply have lit a fire around the encampment which would suffice
      to protect it; but the convicts would more likely be alerted by the
      flames than frightened by them, and it was best in this case to surround
      themselves by darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the watch was strictly organized. Two of the colonists would
      watch together and it was agreed that every two hours they would wake up
      their companions. In spite of his protests, Herbert was relieved of the
      guard. Pencroff and Gideon Spilett on the one hand and the engineer and
      Neb on the other, took turns in mounting guard to the approaches to the
      encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, there were only a few hours to the night. The obscurity was due
      rather to the thickness of the branches than to the disappearance of the
      sun. The silence was barely troubled by the raucous howls of the jaguars
      and the derisive laughter of the apes which seemed particularly to
      irritate Master Jup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed without incident and the next day, the 16th of February,
      the journey, more slow than laborious, was resumed through the forest.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/733.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>The night passed without incident.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      They were only able to make six miles on this day because at every
      instant they had to blaze a trail with the ax. Being true “settlers”, the
      colonists spared the large and fine trees whose felling would besides
      have cost them enormous fatigue. They sacrificed the small ones; but the
      result was that the route hardly followed a straight line and was
      lengthened by numerous detours.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this day, Herbert discovered new species which had not been
      previously seen on the island, such as the tree fern with hanging
      branches that were shaped like water flowing out of a vase, and the carob
      whose long pods the onagers nibbled on eagerly and which would furnish a
      sweetish pulp of excellent taste. There the colonists also found again
      some magnificent kauri trees, arranged by groups, with cylindrical trunks
      crowned by a cone of verdure rising to a height of two hundred feet.
      These were the “king of trees” of New Zealand, as famous as the cedars of
      Lebanon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the fauna, there were no species that had not been previously
      recognized by the hunters. However, without getting near, they caught a
      glimpse of a couple of large birds peculiar to Australia, cassowaries
      which go under the name of emus, and which are five feet tall and of
      brown plumage, belonging to the order of grallatory birds. Top dashed
      after them as fast as his four legs could carry him but the cassowaries
      easily outdistanced him, such was their speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a few more traces left by the convicts in the forest. Near a
      fire which appeared to have been recently extinguished, the colonists
      noticed footprints which they carefully examined. By measuring each
      against the others according to their length and width, they easily
      identified traces of the feet of five men. The five convicts had
      evidently camped in this area; but—and this was the object of a minute
      examination—they could not discover a sixth footprint which, in this case
      would have been Ayrton’s foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton was not with them!” said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Pencroff, “and if he was not with them it is because these
      wretches have already killed him! But these scoundrels therefore do not
      have a den where we can go and track them down like tigers!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the reporter. “It is very likely that they go about at
      random and it is in their interest to roam around in this way until such
      time as they become the masters of the island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The masters of the island!” shouted the sailor. “The masters of the
      island!...” he repeated, and his voice was choked as if an iron collar
      had seized his throat. Then in a calmer voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know, Mister Cyrus,” he said, “what bullet this is that I have
      shoved into my weapon?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Pencroff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the bullet that went through Herbert’s chest and I promise you
      that it will not miss its mark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But these justifiable reprisals would not return Ayrton to life and from
      the examination of the footprints left on the ground they must alas
      conclude that they could no longer hope to see him alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening they camped forty miles from Granite House and Cyrus Smith
      estimated that they were at most five miles from Reptile Promontory.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact, the next day they reached the extremity of the peninsula.
      The forest had been crossed over its entire length but with no indication
      which would allow them to discover the retreat where the convicts took
      refuge nor that of the no less secret sanctuary of the mysterious
      stranger.
