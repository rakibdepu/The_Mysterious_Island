      <b class="cap">A half</b> hour later Cyrus Smith and Herbert returned to
      the camp. The engineer merely told his companions that the land on which
      chance had thrown them was an island and that the next day they would
      consult. Then each made the best sleeping arrangement he could, and in
      this cavity of basalt at a height of two thousand five hundred feet above
      sea level the “islanders” enjoyed a deep sleep on a peaceful night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, March 30th, after a quick breakfast in which the roasted
      tragopan was the only dish, the engineer wanted to ascend to the summit
      of the volcano in order to carefully observe the island on which he and
      his friends would be imprisoned for life perhaps if this island was
      situated far from all land or if it was not near the lanes of ships
      visiting the archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions
      would follow him in this new exploration. They too wanted to see this
      island which they would ask to supply all their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about seven o’clock in the morning when Cyrus Smith, Herbert,
      Pencroff, Gideon Spilett and Neb broke camp. No one appeared uneasy about
      their situation. They doubtless had faith in themselves but it should be
      noted that the basis of this faith was not the same in Cyrus Smith as in
      his companions. The engineer had confidence because he felt capable of
      wresting from this savage nature all that would be necessary for the life
      of his companions and his own and they feared nothing precisely because
      Cyrus Smith was with them. They realized this difference. Pencroff,
      especially since the incident of the rekindled fire, would not despair
      for an instant even if he found himself on a bare rock if the engineer
      was with him on this rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah!” he said. “We left Richmond without the permission of the
      authorities! It would be a hell of a thing if sooner or later we did not
      succeed in leaving a place where no one will certainly detain us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith followed the same path as the day before. They went around
      the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder up to the opening of
      the enormous crevice. The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure
      sky and its rays enveloped the entire eastern side of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the crater. It was just as the engineer had recognized it in
      the darkness, that is to say a vast crater that extended to a height of a
      thousand feet above the plateau. From the base of the crevice, broad
      thick flows of lava had meandered over the sides of the mountain thus
      marking out the route of the eruptive material into the lower valleys
      which criss-crossed the northern portion of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the crater, whose inclination was not more than thirty
      five to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to
      climbing. They saw traces of very old lava which probably poured out at
      the summit of the cone before this lateral crevice opened a new route.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the volcanic chimney which established communication between the
      subterranean levels and the crater, they could not estimate its depth by
      looking at it since it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt
      about the complete extinction of the volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before eight o’clock Cyrus Smith and his companions were gathered at the
      summit of the crater on a conical swelling which puffed up the northern
      rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The sea! The sea everywhere!” they cried as if their lips could not hold
      back this word that made islanders of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the sea was an immense circular expanse around them. Perhaps on
      climbing to the summit of the cone Cyrus Smith had hoped to discover some
      coast, some neighboring island, which he had not been able to see the
      previous evening in the darkness. But nothing appeared within the limits
      of the horizon that is to say for a radius of over fifty miles. No land
      in sight. Not a sail. All this immensity was deserted and the island
      occupied the center of a circumference that seemed to be infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer and his companions, speechless, immobile, looked over all
      the points of the ocean for several minutes. Their eyes examined this
      ocean to its most extreme limits. But Pencroff, who possessed a
      marvellous power of vision, saw nothing, and certainly if land was lying
      on the horizon, even if it appeared as an imperceptible vapor, the sailor
      would undoubtedly recognize it because nature had truly placed two
      telescopes under his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the ocean their attention was fixed on the island which they could
      see in its entirety and the first question was asked by Gideon Spilett in
      these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      “About how large is this island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly it did not appear to be considerable in the midst of this immense
      ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith reflected for several moments. He looked all around the
      island taking into account the height at which they were situated; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friends,” he said, “I believe I am not mistaken in giving the
      shoreline of the island a perimeter of more than one hundred miles.”
      <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      “And consequently, its area?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is difficult to estimate,” replied the engineer, “because it is so
      capriciously indented.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If Cyrus Smith was not mistaken in his evaluation, the island was nearly
      as large as Malta or Zakynthos in the Mediterranian; but at the same time
      it was much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories, points,
      bays, coves, or creeks. Its truly strange form surprised them, and when
      Gideon Spilett sketched its contours at the engineer’s suggestion they
      found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a sort of monstrous
      pteropoda which was sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was in fact the exact configuration of the island which is important
      to know. Its map was immediately drawn by the reporter with sufficient
      precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portion of the coast on which the castaways had landed was curved on
      a large arc and bordered by a vast bay terminated in the southeast by a
      sharp cape which was a point hidden from Pencroff at the time of his
      first exploration. In the northeast two other capes closed the bay and
      between them a narrow gulf was hollowed out which resembled the half
      opened jaw of some formidable shark.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the northeast to the northwest the coast was rounded like the
      flattened skull of a wild beast rising in a sort of protuberance which
      did not assign any very definite plan to this part of the island whose
      center was occupied by the volcanic mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this point on, the coastline was somewhat regular north and south
      cut at two thirds of its length by a narrow creek, beyond which it ended
      in a long tail resembling the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tail formed a true peninsula which extended for more than thirty
      miles into the sea, counting from the southeast cape of the island,
      already mentioned. It was rounded, describing an open roadstead which
      characterized the lower shore of this strangely cut out land.
    </p>
    <p>
      In it smallest width, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek
      observed on the western coast which corresponded to it in latitude, the
      island measured only ten miles, but its greatest length, from the jaw of
      the northeast to the extremity of the tail in the southwest, came to not
      less than thirty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the interior of the island its general aspect was thus: very wooded
      in all of its southern portion from the mountain up to the shore and dry
      and sandy in its northern part. Between the volcano and the east coast
      Cyrus Smith and his companions were rather surprised to see a lake,
      bordered by green trees, whose existence they had not suspected. Seen
      from this height the lake seemed to be at the same level as the sea but
      on reflection the engineer explained to his companions that the altitude
      of this small expanse of water must be three hundred feet because the
      plateau which served as its basin was that high above the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does this lake have sweet water?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Necessarily,” replied the engineer, “because it must be fed by waters
      which flow from the mountain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I see a small brook which flows into it,” said Herbert, pointing to a
      narrow creek whose source must flow from the buttresses in the west.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/134.jpg" border="1" width="333" height="467" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b>“I see a small brook”, said Herbert.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “In fact,” replied Cyrus Smith, “since this stream feeds the lake it is
      probable that there exists an outlet at the sea side by which the
      overflow of water escapes. We will see this on our return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This rather winding watercourse and the river already noted, such was the
      hydrographic system, such at least was developed before the eyes of the
      explorers. However it was possible that under these masses of trees of
      the immense forest which made up two thirds of the island, other streams
      flowed toward the sea. They must even assume it since this fertile and
      rich region showed the most magnificent specimens of the vegetation of
      the temperate zones. As to the northern part, there was no indication of
      flowing water: perhaps some stagnant water in the marshy portions of the
      northeast but that was all; in sum there were dunes, sand and a very
      pronounced aridity which vividly contrasted with the opulence of the soil
      of its larger section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The volcano did not occupy the central part of the island. It stood, on
      the contrary, in the northwest region and seemed to mark the boundary
      between the two zones. Toward the southwest, the south and the southeast,
      the lower levels of the buttresses disappeared under the masses of
      vegetation. In the north, on the contrary, one could follow their
      ramifications which eventually faded into the plains of sand. It was also
      on this coast, during the time of the eruptions, that the discharges had
      opened up a passage and one broad path of lava extended to this narrow
      jaw which formed a gulf in the northeast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions remained thus for a hour on the summit of
      the mountain. The island developed under their eyes like a plan in relief
      with various tints, greens for the forests, yellows for the sands, blues
      for the waters. They saw it in its entirety. The ground hidden under the
      immense vegetation, the bottom of the shaded valleys, the interior of the
      narrow sunken gorges which extended to the foot of the volcano, these
      alone escaped their investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One serious question remained to answer which would singularly influence
      the future of the castaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the island inhabited?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the reporter who posed this question to which it seemed that they
      could already give a negative response after a minute examination which
      they made of the diverse regions of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere could they perceive the work of the human hand. No conglomeration
      of cabins, not an isolated hut, not a fishery on the shore. No fire rose
      to betray the presence of man. It is true that a distance of
      approximately thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme
      points that is to say from this tail which projected to the southwest and
      it would be difficult even for Pencroff’s eyes to discover a habitation
      there. Neither could they lift up the screen of verdure which covered
      three quarters of the island to see if it did or did not hide some
      village. But generally the islanders of these narrow spaces that emerge
      from the Pacific inhabit, for the most part, the shore and the shore
      appeared to be absolutely deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until a more complete exploration they would have to admit that the
      island was uninhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was it frequented, at least temporarily, by the natives from the
      neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this question. No land
      appeared within a radius of approximately fifty miles. But fifty miles
      could easily be crossed, either by Malaysian proas or by large Polynesian
      canoes. All depended on the position of the island, its isolation in the
      Pacific, and its proximity to the archipelagos. Would Cyrus Smith be able
      later to determine their latitude and longitude without instruments? That
      would be difficult. It would be best to take certain precautions against
      a possible visit from neighboring natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration of the island was complete, its configuration determined,
      its outline noted, its area calculated, its hydrography and orography
      recognized. The disposition of the forests and the plains were drawn in a
      general way by the reporter. There was nothing to do but to descend the
      slopes of the mountain and to explore the ground with the triple point of
      view of noting its mineral, vegetable and animal resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before giving his companions the signal to depart, Cyrus Smith said
      to them in a calm and serious voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, my friends, is the small corner of the world on which the hand of
      the Almighty has thrown us. It is here that we are going to live a long
      time perhaps. Perhaps also unexpected help will arrive if some vessel
      passes by chance... I say by chance because this island is not very
      important. It offers nothing which can serve as a port of call for ships,
      and it is to be feared that it is situated outside the ordinary
      shiplanes, that is to say that it is too far to the south for the vessels
      which frequent the archipelagos of the Pacific, too far north for those
      that go to Australia by doubling Cape Horn. I wish to conceal nothing
      from you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you are right, my dear Cyrus,” the reporter replied vividly. “You
      are dealing with men. They have confidence in you and you can count on
      them. Isn’t that so, my friends?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will obey you in everything, Mister Cyrus,” said Herbert who seized
      the engineer’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My master, always and everywhere!” cried Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As to me,” said the sailor, “may I lose my name if I sulk at my work,
      and if you wish it, Mister Smith, we will make this island a Little
      America. We will build towns, we will establish railroads here, we will
      install telegraphs and one fine day when it will be transformed and
      civilized we will offer it to the government of the Union! Only I ask one
      thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That we no longer think of ourselves as castaways but as colonists
      coming here to colonize.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith could not restrain a smile and the sailor’s motion was
      adopted. Then he thanked his companions and added that he counted on
      their energy and on the blessing of Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then, on to the Chimneys!” cried Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One moment, my friends,” replied the engineer. “It seems best to me to
      give a name to this island, also to its capes, to its promontories and to
      the watercourses that we have seen below.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very good,” said the reporter. “In the future this will simplify the
      instructions that we will have to give or to follow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact,” replied the sailor, “it is already something to be able to say
      where one has been and where one is going. At least one has the feeling
      of having been somewhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Chimneys, for example,” said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Right!” replied Pencroff. “This name, which has already been very
      convenient, came to me all alone. Shall we keep this name of the Chimneys
      for our first encampment, Mister Cyrus?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Pencroff, since you have so baptized it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good! As to the others, that will be easy,” replied the sailor, who was
      in good spirits. “Let us use names like the Robinsons did. Herbert has
      read their story to me more than once; ‘Providence Bay,’ ‘Cachalots
      Point,’ ‘Cape of Deceived Hope’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or rather the names of Mister Smith,” replied Herbert, “of Mister
      Spilett, of Neb!...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name!” cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?” replied Pencroff. “‘Port Neb’ would be very good. And ‘Cape
      Gideon.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would prefer names borrowed from our country” replied the reporter,
      “which would remind us of America.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, for the main features,” Cyrus Smith then said, “for those of the
      bays or the seas, I readily grant it. We could give to this vast bay in
      the east the name Union Bay for example, to this large indentation in the
      south that of Washington Bay, to the mountain on which we are now
      standing that of Mount Franklin, to the lake which extends beneath us
      that of Lake Grant, nothing could be better my friends. These names will
      remind us of our country and those great citizens who have honored it,
      but for the rivers, the gulfs, the capes and the promontories which we
      perceive from the top of this mountain, let us choose names which will
      rather recall their particular configuration. It will make a deeper
      impression on us and it will be practical at the same time. The shape of
      the island is sufficiently strange so that we will have no difficulty in
      imagining names which recall it. As to the watercourses that we do not
      know, the various parts of the forest that we will explore later, the
      creeks that will be discovered in due time, we will name that when they
      present themselves to us. What do you think, my friends?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer’s proposition was unanimously adopted by his companions. The
      island was there under their eyes like an open map, and they had only to
      specify names for all its features. Gideon Spilett would draw it to scale
      and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be formally
      adopted.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

        <b>Gideon Spilett would draw it to scale.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      First they named Union Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, for the
      two bays and the mountain as the engineer had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said the reporter, “this peninsula which projects to the southwest
      of the island, I propose to give it the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and
      the name Reptile End to the curved tail at its end because it is truly a
      reptile’s tail.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Adopted,” said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Herbert, “for this other extremity of the island, this gulf
      which so singularly resembles an open jaw, let us call it Shark Gulf.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well done!” cried Pencroff, “and we will complete the picture by giving
      the two parts of the jaw the name Mandible Cape.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But there are two capes,” the reporter observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then,” replied Pencroff, “we will have North Mandible Cape and
      South Mandible Cape.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are inscribed,” replied Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It remains to name the point at the southeast extremity of the island,”
      said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is to say the extremity of Union Bay?” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cape Claw,” Neb cried out at once. He also wanted to be the godfather of
      some piece of his domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in truth Neb had found an excellent name because this cape truly
      represented the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which resembled the
      outline of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff was enchanted by the turn of events. Their somewhat overexcited
      imaginations soon had given:
    </p>
    <p>
      To the river which furnished fresh water to the colonists near where the
      balloon had thrown them, the name of the Mercy, a true thanks to
      Providence;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the islet on which the castaways had first set foot, the name of
      Safety Island;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the plateau which crowned the high wall of granite above the Chimneys
      and from where they could see all of the vast bay, the name Grand View
      Plateau;
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally to all of this massive impenetrable woods which covered
      Serpentine Peninsula, the name of Forests of the Far West.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was thus
      finished and later they would complete it with new discoveries as they
      went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the orientation of the island the engineer had determined it
      approximately by the height and the position of the sun which put Union
      Bay and all of Grand View Plateau to the east. But the next day by taking
      the exact time of sunrise and sunset and by determining the sun’s
      position at the midpoint between sunrise and sunset he would exactly fix
      the north of the island. Because they were located in the southern
      hemisphere the sun, at the precise moment of reaching its highest point,
      would pass to the north and not to the south in its apparent movement as
