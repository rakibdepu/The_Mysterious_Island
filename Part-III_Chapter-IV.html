      <b class="cap">“They’ve</b> blown up!” shouted Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! Blown up just as if Ayrton had ignited their powder,” replied
      Pencroff, throwing himself into the elevator while Neb and the lad were
      doing likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what happened?” asked Gideon Spilett, still stupefied by the
      unexpected denouement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! This time we will know...” replied the engineer vividly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What will we know?...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Later! later! Come Spilett. The important thing is that these pirates
      have been exterminated!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cyrus Smith, hurrying the reporter and Ayrton along, joined Pencroff,
      Neb and Herbert on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      They no longer saw anything of the brig, not even its mast. After having
      been raised by this waterspout, it was thrown on its side and had
      foundered in this position, doubtless as a result of some enormous water
      flooding. But inasmuch as the channel at this point did not measure more
      than twenty feet in depth, it was certain that the sides of the immersed
      brig would reappear at low tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some wreckage was floating on the surface of the sea. They saw spare
      masts and yards, poultry cages with their occupants still living, chests
      and barrels which little by little rose to the surface after having
      gotten out through the hatchways; but there was no other drifting debris,
      neither the planking from the deck nor from the hull—this made the
      sinking of the <i>Speedy</i> rather inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the two masts, which had broken a few feet above the partner
      after having snapped their stays and shrouds, soon rose to the surface of
      the channel with their sails, some unfurled and others rolled up. But it
      was best not to wait until the ebb tide carried away all these riches.
      Ayrton and Pencroff threw themselves into the canoe with the intention of
      mooring all of the wreckage be it on the shore of the island or on the
      shore of the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as they were about to leave a thought from Gideon Spilett
      stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what about the six convicts who went ashore on the right bank of the
      Mercy?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, they must not forget that the six men whose boat had broken on
      the rocks had set foot at Flotsom Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were visible. It was
      probable that, after having seen the brig engulfed by the waters of the
      channel, they had fled into the island’s interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will concern ourselves with them later,” Cyrus Smith then said. “They
      could still be dangerous because they are armed, but now with six against
      six the chances are equal. Let’s attend to the most urgent business
      first.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton and Pencroff got into the boat and vigorously paddled to the
      wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide was then slack and very high since the moon had been new two
      days earlier. A full hour at least must pass before the hull of the brig
      would emerge from the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton and Pencroff used the time to moor down the masts and the spars
      with ropes whose ends were anchored at the Granite House beach. There the
      colonists, working together, succeeded in hauling up the wreckage. Then,
      with the canoe, they collected everything that was floating, poultry
      cages, barrels, and cases which were immediately transported to the
      Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few bodies were floating on the surface. Among others, Ayrton
      recognized that of Bob Harvey and he pointed him out to his companion
      while saying with an emotional voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what I have been, Pencroff!”
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/643.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>“That is what I have been, Pencroff!”</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      “But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!” replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather strange that so few bodies were floating. They barely
      counted five or six which the ebb tide was already beginning to carry out
      to the open sea. Most likely the convicts, surprised by the engulfment,
      had not had the time to flee and with the vessel lying on its side, most
      of them had been caught under the bulwarks. The tide would drag the
      bodies of these wretches to the high seas and would save the colonists
      the sad task of burying them in some corner of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours, Cyrus Smith and his companions were only occupied with
      hauling the spars on to the beach. Then they stretched out the perfectly
      intact sails to dry out. They spoke little, since their work absorbed
      them but what thoughts were on their minds! The brig contained a fortune.
      In fact, a vessel is like a small but complete world and the stores of
      the colony would be increased by many useful items. It would be, on a
      large scale, the equivalent of the case found at Flotsom Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And besides,” thought Pencroff, “why would it be impossible to refloat
      this brig? If it is only a water leak, that can be sealed. A vessel of
      three or four hundred tons is a real vessel compared to our
      <i>Bonadventure</i>. And we can go quite a distance with it! It will go
      wherever we want. Mister Cyrus, Ayrton and I must examine it. It would be
      worth the trouble.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, if the brig could be made seaworthy, then the colonists’ chances
      of returning to their native land would be remarkably increased. But to
      decide this important question, they must wait for low tide in order to
      examine every part of the hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wreckage had been secured on shore, Cyrus Smith and his
      companions devoted a few moments to eating. They were literally dying of
      hunger. Happily, the pantry was not far away and Neb could pass for a
      ship’s cook if need be. So they dined near the Chimneys and during this
      meal they thought about the unexpected event which had so miraculously
      saved the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Miraculously is the word,” repeated Pencroff, “because it must be
      admitted that these rascals were blown up at a most opportune time.
      Granite House was oddly becoming uninhabitable!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And can you imagine, Pencroff,” asked the reporter, “what occurred to
      bring on the brig’s explosion?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Mister Spilett, nothing is more simple,” replied Pencroff. “A
      pirate ship is not run like a warship. Convicts are not sailors! It is
      certain that the powder room of the brig was open since they were firing
      on us without letup and it would suffice for someone imprudent or
      careless to blow up the works.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Cyrus,” said Herbert, “what astonishes me is that this explosion
      has not produced a greater effect. The detonation was not strong and in
      short there is little debris or torn planking. It would seem that it
      foundered rather than that it blew up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does that astonish you, my child?” asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Mister Cyrus.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And me too, Herbert,” replied the engineer, “it astonishes me; but when
      we will visit the brig’s hull we will doubtless find the explanation for
      this event.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So then, Mister Cyrus,” said Pencroff, “you are not going to allege that
      the <i>Speedy</i> simply foundered like a ship that struck a rock?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not?” noted Neb, “if there are rocks in the channel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s fine, Neb,” replied Pencroff. “You did not have your eyes open at
      the right moment. An instant before the engulfment, as I saw perfectly,
      the ship was raised by an enormous wave and fell back on its port side.
      Now if it had only struck a rock it would have foundered tranquilly like
      an honest vessel going to the bottom.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it was not an honest vessel, strictly speaking,” replied Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will take a good look, Pencroff,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will take a good look,” added the sailor, “but I will bet my head
      that there are no rocks in the channel. Look here, Mister Cyrus, to speak
      frankly, would you say that there was something strange in this event?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In any case,” said Gideon Spilett, “impact or explosion, you will agree,
      Pencroff, that it came just in time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes!... yes!...” replied the sailor, “...but that is not the question. I
      ask Mister Smith if he sees anything supernatural in this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not know, Pencroff,” said the engineer. “That is all that I can say
      to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This reply did not satisfy Pencroff. He insisted on “an explosion” and he
      would not give in. He would not admit that this channel, formed of a bed
      of sand like the beach itself, and which he had often crossed at low
      tide, had some unknown rock. And besides, it was high tide when the brig
      sank, that is to say that there was enough water to cross over, without
      bumping any rocks that did not appear at low tide. Therefore there could
      not have been any impact. Therefore the vessel had not collided.
      Therefore it had blown up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it must be admitted that the sailor’s logic did not lack a certain
      justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      About one thirty, the colonists got into the canoe and went to the place
      where the stranding had occurred. It was regrettable that the two boats
      from the brig had not been salvaged; but as we know one had been broken
      up at the mouth of the Mercy and was absolutely useless; the other had
      disappeared when the brig went down and had doubtless been crushed by it
      since it had not reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the <i>Speedy</i>’s hull began to show itself above the
      water. The brig had done more than fall on its side because after having
      snapped its masts under the weight of the falling ballast, it had brought
      its keel almost into the air. It had truly been turned upside down by the
      inexplicable but frightful submarine action which had at the same time
      been manifested by the displacement of an enormous waterspout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists made a tour of the hull and as the tide continued to go
      down, they were able to discover, if not the cause which had provoked the
      catastrophe, at least the effect produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up front, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet before the
      beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig had been frightfully torn up
      for a length of at least twenty feet. There were two large water leaks
      which would be impossible to plug up. Not only had the copper bottom and
      the sheathing disappeared, doubtless pulverized to dust, but there was no
      longer any trace of the framework itself, nor of the iron bolts and
      treenails which fastened them. Along the entire length of the hull up to
      the stern, the strakes were torn to shreds, no longer sea worthy. The
      false keel had been separated with an inexplicable violence and the keel
      itself, torn from the keelson at several points, was broken along its
      entire length.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand devils!” shouted Pencroff. “Here is a vessel which will be
      difficult to refloat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It will even be impossible,” said Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In any case,” Gideon Spilett said to the sailor, “the explosion, if it
      was an explosion, has produced strange effects. It has damaged the inside
      of the hull instead of blowing up the deck and the upper structure. These
      large openings appear to have been made by a collision with a rock rather
      than by the explosion of the powder room.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is no rock in the channel” replied the sailor. “I will admit to
      anything you wish, except a collision with a rock!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us try to get inside the brig,” said the engineer. “Perhaps we will
      then know what caused its destruction.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the best thing to do and it was agreed besides to inventory all
      the riches contained on board and to decide on their disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access to the brig’s interior was then easy. The tide was low and they
      reached the lower side of the deck, which had now become the upper side
      because the hull had turned over. The ballast, composed of heavy pig
      iron, was smashed in several places. They heard the splashing sea flowing
      in through several fissures in the hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions, with ax in hand, advanced along the half
      broken deck. Cases of all sorts obstructed the deck and since these cases
      had been in the water for only a limited time, their contents might not
      be damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then occupied themselves with putting all of this cargo in a secure
      place. The water would not return for several hours and this time was
      used profitably. Ayrton and Pencroff fastened a tackle at a practical
      opening in the hull which served to hoist the barrels and the cases. The
      canoe received them and transported them immediately to the beach. They
      took everything without discrimination, leaving for later the task of
      sorting out these objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case the colonists took satisfaction from the very varied cargo
      which the brig contained, an assortment of articles of all sorts,
      utensils, manufactured products and tools such as are carried by the
      ships which trade with Polynesia. It was probable that they would find a
      little of everything and they agreed that that was precisely what the
      colony of Lincoln Island needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, and Cyrus Smith noted this in astonished silence, not only the
      brig’s hull, as has been said, had suffered enormously from the collision
      whatever the cause, but the interior arrangements lay in waste especially
      toward the bow. Bulkheads and stanchions were broken as if some
      formidable shell had exploded inside the brig. After having removed the
      cases as they went along, the colonists could now move easily from bow to
      stern. These cases were not heavy bales whose removal would have been
      difficult, but simple packages which were no longer recognizable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists then reached that part of the brig’s stern which was
      formerly above the poop deck. It was there that, according to Ayrton’s
      directions, they must look for the powder room. Cyrus Smith thought that
      if it had not exploded, it was possible that a few barrels could be
      salvaged and that the powder, which is ordinarily enclosed in metal
      envelopes, would not have suffered from contact with the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was in fact, what had occurred. They found, among a large quantity
      of projectiles, about twenty copper lined barrels which they carefully
      removed. Pencroff was convinced by his own eyes that the destruction of
      the <i>Speedy</i> could not be attributed to an explosion. The portion of
      the hull in which the powder room was situated was precisely the one that
      had suffered the least.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/650.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>They found about twenty barrels.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      “Possibly,” replied the stubborn sailor, “but as to a rock, there is no
      rock in the channel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what happened?” asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know anything about it,” replied Pencroff, “Mister Cyrus doesn’t
      know anything about it, no one knows about it or will ever know anything
      about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Several hours passed during these various activities, and the rising tide
      began to be felt. It was necessary to suspend the salvage work. Besides,
      they did not need to fear that the remains of the brig would float away
      to sea because it was already sunk into the mud as firmly as if it had
      been moored with its anchors.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could therefore wait without inconvenience for the next ebb tide to
      resume their operations. But as to the ship itself, it was doomed and it
      would even be necessary to make haste in salvaging the debris from the
      hull because it would not be long in disappearing into the shifting sand
      of the channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five o’clock in the evening. The day had been a rough one for the
      laborers. They ate with a good appetite but in spite of their fatigue
      they could not resist the desire, after dinner, to inspect the cases
      which comprised the cargo of the <i>Speedy</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part they contained ready made clothing which, as we can
      imagine, was well received. There was enough to clothe the entire colony,
      with linen for every usage and shoes for every foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are rich,” shouted Pencroff. “But what are we going to do with all of
      this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      And at each instant hurrahs burst forth from the happy sailor when he
      recognized barrels of rum, cases of tobacco, firearms and bladed weapons,
      bales of cotton, laborer’s tools and tools for the carpenter, the cabinet
      maker and the blacksmith, and boxes of seed of all varieties. Their short
      stay in the water had not damaged them. Ah! If these things had come only
      two years earlier. But even now that these industrious colonists had
      tools of their own, these riches would find use.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no lack of space in the storerooms of Granite House but on this
      day they did not have enough time to store everything. They must not
      forget that six survivors of the <i>Speedy</i>’s crew had set foot on the
      island, that they were truly scamps of the first order, and that they
      must guard against them. Even though the bridge across the Mercy and the
      smaller bridges were raised, the convicts would not be inconvenienced by
      a river or a brook, and driven by despair, rascals such as these could be
      formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would see later what steps it would be best to take in this matter;
      but in the meantime they must keep watch over the cases and packages
      piled up near the Chimneys, and that is what the colonists took turns in
      doing during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night however passed without the convicts attempting any attack.
      Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would have
      given some signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three days which followed, the 19th, 20th and 21th of October, were
      used to salvage everything that could have any value or use whatsoever,
      either from the cargo or from the rigging of the brig. At low tide they
      removed everything from the hold. At high tide they stored what they had
      salvaged. A large part of the copper lining had been torn off the hull
      which each day, sunk further into the sand. But before the sand had
      engulfed the heavy objects that had sunk to the bottom, Ayrton and
      Pencroff had several times plunged down to the bed of the channel to
      recover the chains and anchors of the brig, the pig iron of its ballast
      and even four cannons which, lightened by empty barrels, they were able
      to bring to land.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we can see, the colony’s arsenal gained as much from the salvage as
      the pantry and storerooms of Granite House. Pencroff, always enthusiastic
      about his projects, already spoke of constructing a battery which would
      command the channel and the mouth of the river. With four cannons they
      could prevent any navy “however powerful it might be” from venturing into
      the waters of Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing now remained of the brig but a useless carcass. Bad weather
      completed its destruction. Cyrus Smith had intended to blow it up in
      order to recover the debris on the shore but a strong northeast wind and
      a strong sea allowed him to economize his powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, on the night of the 23rd to the 24th, the hull of the brig was
      completely dismantled and a part of the wreckage was stranded on the
      beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to any papers on board, needless to say, Cyrus Smith could find no
      trace however carefully he searched the closets of the poop deck. The
      pirates had evidently destroyed every reference to the captain and to the
      ownership of the <i>Speedy</i>, and since the homeport was not given on
      any aft nameplate, they had no clue as to its nationality. However, from
      the forward shape of the vessel, Ayrton and Pencroff thought that the
      brig was of English construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight days after the catastrophe, or rather after the fortunate but
      inexplicable denouement to which the colony owed its salvation, they
      could no longer see anything of the vessel, not even at low tide. Its
      debris had been dispersed and Granite House was enriched by nearly all
      that it had contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the mystery of its strange destruction would doubtless have
      never been cleared up if on the 30th of November Neb, while roaming about
      the beach, had not found a thick piece of an iron cylinder which bore the
      traces of an explosion. This cylinder was twisted and broken as if it had
      been subjected to the action of an explosive substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb brought this piece of metal to his master who was then occupied with
      his companions at the Chimneys workshop.

      Cyrus Smith examined this cylinder carefully and then turning to
      Pencroff:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You persist, my friend,” he said to him, “in maintaining that the
      <i>Speedy</i> did not perish as a result of a collision?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor, “you know as well as I do that
      there are no rocks in the channel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if it had run up against this piece of iron?” said the engineer,
      showing him the broken cylinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, this stump of pipe?” shouted Pencroff, with a completely
      incredulous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friends,” replied Cyrus Smith, “do you recall that before foundering,
      the brig was raised to the summit of a real waterspout?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Mister Cyrus,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, do you want to know what brought on this waterspout? It was this,”
      said the engineer, showing the broken tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This?” replied Pencroff.

      “Yes! This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A torpedo!” shouted the engineer’s companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And who put this torpedo there?” asked Pencroff, not wanting to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All that I can tell you is that it wasn’t I,” replied Cyrus Smith, “but
      it was there, and you were able to judge its incomparable power!”
