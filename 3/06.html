    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">However,</b> the principal preoccupation of the colonists
      was to conduct a complete exploration of the island, which had been
      decided upon, an exploration which now had two goals: first, to discover
      the mysterious being whose existence was no longer in doubt and at the
      same time, to find out what had become of the pirates, what retreat they
      had chosen, what life they were leading and what they would have to fear
      from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith wanted to leave without delay; but for an expedition that
      would last several days, they would find it convenient to load up the
      cart with various things needed for the encampments, and with utensils
      which would make their stopovers easier. Now at this time, one of the
      onagers had hurt his leg and could not be harnessed; he needed a few days
      of rest and they could put off the departure for a week without
      inconvenience, that is to say until the 20th of November. The month of
      November, under this latitude, corresponds to the month of May in the
      northern zones. They were therefore in the fine season. The sun had
      arrived over the Tropic of Capricorn and gave the longest days of the
      year. The time was hence favorable for the planned expedition which, if
      it did not attain its main goal, could be fruitful in discoveries,
      especially from the point of view of the island’s natural productions.
      Cyrus Smith proposed that they explore those thick forests of the Far
      West which extended up to the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the nine days that preceded their departure, it was agreed that
      they would put the finishing touches on their work on Grand View Plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      However it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral where the
      domestic animals needed care. It was decided that he would pass two days
      there and that he would return to Granite House after having abundantly
      stocked the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was about to leave, Cyrus Smith asked him if he wanted someone to
      accompany him, making a comment that the island was less secure than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton replied that it wasn’t necessary, that he could do the work alone
      and that besides, he feared nothing. If some incident occurred at the
      corral or in the neighborhood, he would immediately inform the colonists
      with a telegram to Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton therefore left on the 9th at daybreak, leading the cart harnessed
      to only one onager and two hours later the electric bell announced that
      he had found everything in order at the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these two days, Cyrus Smith was occupied with a project which
      would positively protect Granite House from any surprise. His purpose was
      to completely conceal the upper opening of the old passageway which had
      already been cemented and half hidden under grass and plants at the
      southern corner of Lake Grant. Nothing would be easier since it would
      suffice to raise the level of the lake by two or three feet so that the
      opening would then be completely submerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to raise this level, he had only to build a dam at the two trenches
      of the lake which fed Glycerin Creek and Grand Falls Creek. The colonists
      were urged on in this work and two dams, not exceeding seven or eight
      feet in length and three in height, were quickly erected by means of well
      cemented lumps of rock.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>The colonists were urged on in this work.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      With this work completed, it was impossible to guess at which point of
      the lake there existed a subterranean passage through which the overflow
      had formerly escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that the small diversion of water which served to
      supply the Granite House reservoir and to drive the elevator had been
      carefully spared and that there would be no lack of water in any case.
      Once the elevator was raised, this secure and comfortable retreat defied
      any surprise attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      This task moved forward quickly so that Pencroff, Gideon Spilett and
      Herbert found the time for a trip to Port Balloon. The sailor wanted very
      much to know if the small cove in which the <i>Bonadventure</i> had been
      anchored, had been visited by the convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be precise,” he noted, “these gentlemen set foot on the southern
      coast and if they followed the shoreline it is to be feared that they
      have discovered the little port in which case I would not give a
      half-dollar for our <i>Bonadventure</i> .”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff’s apprehensions were not without some foundation and a visit to
      Port Balloon seemed to be most opportune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and his companions therefore left after lunch on the 10th of
      November and they were well armed. Pencroff, while conspicuously sliding
      two balls into each barrel of his gun, shook his head, which did not
      forebode anything good for whoever came too close, be it “man or beast”,
      as he said. Gideon Spilett and Herbert also took their weapons and at
      about three o’clock all three left Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb accompanied them just up to the bend in the Mercy and after they
      passed he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot would announce
      the return of the colonists and that at this signal Neb would return to
      re-establish communication between the two banks of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small troop advanced directly by the port route toward the southern
      coast of the island. It was only a distance of three and a half miles but
      Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to traverse it. They
      probed all along the route which included the edges of the thick forest
      which bordered on Tadorn’s marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives
      who doubtless, still not knowing how many colonists there were nor their
      means of defense, had gone to the less accessible portions of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Port Balloon, Pencroff saw with extreme satisfaction that the
      <i>Bonadventure</i> was tranquilly anchored in the narrow creek. Besides,
      Port Balloon was so well hidden among these high rocks that it could not
      be discovered neither from land nor from sea, except if one were higher
      up or within the cove.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So then,” said Pencroff, “these rascals still have not been here. Tall
      grass suits reptiles better, and it is evident that we will find them in
      the Far West.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And that is very fortunate because if they had found the
      <i>Bonadventure</i>,” added Herbert, “they would have taken possession of
      it and fled, and that would have prevented us from returning soon to
      Tabor Island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact,” replied the reporter, “it is important that we bring a
      document there which will make known our situation on Lincoln Island and
      Ayrton’s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht comes to bring him
      back.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, the <i>Bonadventure</i> is always there, Mister Spilett,” replied
      the sailor. “It and its crew are ready to leave at the first signal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think, Pencroff, that we should do this as soon as our exploration of
      the island is completed. It is possible, after all, that this stranger,
      if we succeed in finding him, knows a great deal about Lincoln Island and
      about Tabor Island. Let us not forget that he is the incontestable author
      of the document and perhaps he knows about the return of the yacht.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand devils!” shouted Pencroff, “can that be so? This person knows
      us and we do not know him. If he is a simple castaway, why does he hide
      himself? We are worthy people, I suppose, and the society of worthy
      people is not disagreeable to anyone. Did he come here voluntarily?
      Perhaps he leaves the island whenever it pleases him? Is he still here?
      Is he no longer here?...”
    </p>
    <p>
      While chatting, Pencroff, Herbert and Gideon Spilett went on board and
      surveyed the deck of the <i>Bonadventure</i>. The sailor examined the
      bitt on which he had fastened the anchor cable and suddenly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! Upon my word,” he shouted, “that’s outrageous!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it, Pencroff?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was not I who made this knot!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pencroff pointed to the cord which held the cable fast to the bitt
      itself, to prevent it from getting atrip of the anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, it was not you?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No! I swear it. This is a reef knot and I am in the habit of making a
      double half-hitch<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You could be mistaken, Pencroff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not mistaken,” affirmed the sailor. “The hand does it naturally and
      the hand is not mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then have the convicts been on board?” asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know nothing about that,” replied Pencroff, “but this much is certain,
      that the anchor of the <i>Bonadventure</i> was raised and then lowered
      anew. And hold on! Here is another proof. The cable of the anchor was
      payed out and its trimming<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> has no wear left
      at the hawse-hole. I say again that someone used our boat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if the convicts had helped themselves to it, they would either have
      ransacked it or fled...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fled!... to where?... to Tabor Island?...” replied Pencroff. “Do you
      think that they would have taken a chance with such a light boat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides, it would be necessary to admit that they know about the islet,”
      replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be it as it may,” said the sailor, “as sure as my name is Bonadventure
      Pencroff of the Vineyard, our <i>Bonadventure</i> has sailed without us!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor said this so positively that neither Gideon Spilett nor
      Herbert could question his word. It was evident that the boat had been
      moved more or less since Pencroff had brought it to Port Balloon. As to
      the sailor, he had no doubt that the anchor had been raised and then
      dropped later to the bottom. Now what was the purpose of these two
      maneuvers if the boat had not been used for some expedition?
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how could we not have seen the <i>Bonadventure</i> pass in sight of
      the island?” noted the reporter, who tried to raise all possible
      objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Mister Spilett,” replied the sailor, “it would suffice for it to
      leave at night with a good breeze and in two hours it would be out of
      sight.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then,” replied Gideon Spilett, “I ask again what purpose would the
      convicts have in using the <i>Bonadventure</i> and why, after having used
      it, would they return it to port?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Mister Spilett,” replied the sailor, “let us add that to the list
      of those inexplicable things and think no more about it. The important
      thing is that the <i>Bonadventure</i> went and came back. Unfortunately,
      if the convicts take it a second time, they may not return it to its
      place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then Pencroff,” said Herbert, “perhaps it would be prudent to put the
      <i>Bonadventure</i> in front of Granite House?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes and no,” replied Pencroff, “or rather no. The mouth of the Mercy is
      a bad place for a boat and the sea is rough there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But we could haul it up on the sand to the very foot of the Chimneys...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps... yes...,” replied Pencroff. “In any case, since we must leave
      Granite House for a rather long expedition, I think that the
      <i>Bonadventure</i> will be more secure here during our absence and that
      we will do well to leave it here until such time as the island is purged
      of these rascals.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is also my opinion,” said the reporter. “At least in case of bad
      weather, it will not be as exposed as it would be at the mouth of the
      Mercy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if the convicts come again to pay it a visit!” said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my son,” replied Pencroff, “if they didn’t find it here, they
      would be quick to look for it in front of Granite House, and during our
      absence nothing would prevent them from seizing it. I think therefore, as
      Mister Spilett does, that it should be left at Port Balloon. But when we
      return, if we have not rid the island of these scoundrels, it would be
      prudent to bring our boat back to Granite House until such time as we
      need no longer fear any unpleasant visit.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Agreed. Let us be on our way,” said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned to Granite House, Pencroff, Herbert and Gideon Spilett
      let the engineer know what had happened and the latter approved of their
      arrangement for the present and for the future. He even promised the
      sailor that he would examine the portion of the channel situated between
      the islet and the shore in order to see if it would be possible to create
      an artificial port by means of dams. In this way the <i>Bonadventure</i>
      would always be within reach, under the colonist’s eyes, and if need be,
      under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening they sent a telegram to Ayrton asking him to bring a
      couple of goats which Neb wanted to acclimatize to the prairies of the
      plateau. It was strange that Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of
      the dispatch as he usually did. This did not surprise the engineer.
      Perhaps at the moment, Ayrton was not at the corral or even on his way
      back to Granite House. In fact, two days had already passed since his
      departure and it had been decided that on the 10th toward evening or the
      morning of the 11th at the latest, he would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists therefore waited for Ayrton to show himself at the Grand
      View heights. Neb and Herbert even waited at the approaches to the bridge
      in order to lower it as soon as their companion presented himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But around ten o’clock in the evening, there was no longer any question
      about Ayrton. They therefore agreed to send a new dispatch asking for an
      immediate response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Granite House bell remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists then became very anxious. What had happened? Was Ayrton no
      longer at the corral or if he was still there, did he no longer have the
      liberty of his movements? Should they go to the corral on this dark
      night?
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed it. Some wanted to leave, others to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Herbert, “perhaps the telegraphic apparatus is broken and is
      no longer functioning?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That may be,” said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us wait until tomorrow,” said Cyrus Smith. “It is possible, in fact,
      that Ayrton has not received our dispatch or even that we have not
      received his.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited and, as may be imagined, not without a certain anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak on the 11th of November, Cyrus Smith again threw the electric
      current across the wire and received no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried again: the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go to the corral!” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And well armed,” added Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      They decided at once that Granite House should not be deserted and that
      Neb would remain there. After having accompanied his companions to
      Glycerin Creek, he would raise the bridge and, hiding behind a tree he
      would watch either for their return or for Ayrton’s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the pirates presented themselves and tried to cross, he would
      attempt to stop them with gunfire, and finally he would take refuge
      inside Granite House where, once the elevator was raised, he would be
      secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith, Gideon Spilett, Herbert and Pencroff would go directly to
      the corral and, if they did not find Ayrton there, they would scour the
      woods in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o’clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions
      crossed Glycerin Creek and Neb posted himself behind a slight shoulder
      which overlooked some large dragon trees on the left bank of the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having left Grand View Plateau, the colonists immediately took the
      road to the corral. They carried their guns in their arms ready to fire
      at the least hostile demonstration. The two carbines and the two rifles
      had been loaded with ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each side of the road, the woods were thick and could easily hide the
      malefactors who, thanks to their weapons, would be truly formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists moved quickly and in silence. Top preceded them, sometimes
      on the road, sometimes making a detour into the woods, but always silent
      and not appearing to anticipate anything unusual. And they could count on
      the faithful dog not to leave them in surprise and to bark at the least
      appearance of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time that they were following the road, Cyrus Smith and his
      companions were also following the telegraphic wire which linked the
      corral and Granite House. After travelling for about two miles, they
      still did not note any break in its continuity. The posts were in good
      condition, the insulators intact and the wire was properly extended.
      However, beyond this point, the engineer saw that the tension seemed to
      diminish and finally at post No. 74, Herbert, who was ahead of the
      others, stopped and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The wire is broken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions quickened their pace and arrived at the place where the
      lad had stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the post was thrown down across the road. The break in the
      continuity of the wire was thus confirmed and it was evident that the
      dispatches from Granite House had not been received at the corral nor
      those of the corral at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was not the wind that threw over this post,” noted Pencroff.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

        <b>“It was not the wind that threw over this post.”</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Gideon Spilett. “The ground has been dug up around its base
      and it was uprooted by the hand of man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides, the wire is broken,” added Herbert, showing the two ends of the
      iron wire that had been violently torn apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is the fracture a recent one?” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Herbert. “It was certainly ruptured a short time ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the corral! to the corral!” shouted the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were then midway between Granite House and the corral. Thus
      there still remained two and a half miles for them to cover. They took to
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it was to be feared that something serious had occurred at the
      corral. The reason for their anxiety was not the question of the receipt
      of a telegram from Ayrton but a more inexplicable circumstance, that
      Ayrton had promised to return on the previous evening and had not done
      so. Finally, it was not without a motive that all communication had been
      interrupted between the corral and Granite House and who besides the
      convicts had any interest in interrupting this communication?
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists therefore ran, their hearts gripped with emotion. They were
      sincerely attached to their new companion. Would they find him wounded by
      the very men he had once commanded?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they arrived at the place where the road skirted along the small
      stream leading into Red Creek, which irrigated the prairies of the
      corral. They then moderated their steps in order not to find themselves
      out of breath just when a fight might become necessary. The guns did not
      have their safety catches on but were cocked. Each one surveyed a side of
