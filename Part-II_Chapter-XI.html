<p class="huge">
    <b class="cap">Winter</b> arrived with the month of June which is the
    December of the northern hemisphere and the main occupation was the
    making of warm and sturdy clothing.
</p>
<p>
    The sheep at the corral had been divested of their wool and it was now a
    matter of transforming this precious textile material into fabric.
</p>
<p>
    It goes without saying that Cyrus Smith, not having either a carding
    machine, nor a wool-combing machine, nor a smoothing machine, nor a
    drawing machine, nor a twisting machine, nor a “Mule-Jenny,” nor a
    “self-acting” machine to spin the wool, nor a loom to weave it with, had
    to proceed in a simpler way that would save the spinning and weaving. In
    fact, he intended simply to make use of the property that wool filaments
    have when pressed in all directions, that of becoming entangled and
    criss-crossed into a material called felt. This felt could be obtained by
    a simple pressing, an operation which, if it diminished the softness of
    the fabric, significantly increased its heat insulating properties. The
    wool furnished by the sheep was made of very short strands which was good
    for felting.
</p>
<p>
    The engineer, aided by his companions including Pencroff—he had to
    abandon his boat once more—began the preliminary operations which had as
    its goal to rid the wool of this oily and greasy substance with which it
    is impregnated and which is called suint. This degreasing was done in
    wash-tubs in which the wool was immersed for twenty four hours at a
    temperature of seventy degrees. Then it was thoroughly washed in a soda
    bath. Later it would be squeezed dry, becoming compressed and producing a
    firm felt, rough doubtless and of no value in the industrial centers of
    Europe or America but which would be highly appreciated in the “markets
    of Lincoln Island.”
</p>
<p>
    This kind of fabric has been known from the earliest times and the first
    wool fabric was made by this very procedure that Cyrus Smith was going to
    use.
</p>
<p>
    Where his abilities as an engineer would be needed was in the
    construction of a machine to press the wool, because he knew how to
    profit from the unused mechanical force inherent in the water falling on
    the beach to actuate a pressing machine.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing was more rudimentary. A shaft, provided with lifters which would
    raise and lower vertical hammers on each revolution, troughs to receive
    the wool on which the hammers would fall, a strong timber housing to
    support the entire system and hold it together: such was the machine in
    question and such it has been throughout the centuries, until the hammers
    were replaced by compressing cylinders which no longer subjected the
    material to a beating but to a real rolling action.
</p>
<p>
    The operation, well supervised by Cyrus Smith, succeeded as they had
    hoped. The wool, previously impregnated with a soapy solution intended on
    the one hand to facilitate the sliding action, the compression and the
    softening and, on the other hand, to prevent its alteration from the
    thrashing, left the mill as a thick layer of felt. The streaks and
    coarseness with which the strands of wool are naturally provided with
    were so well intertwined with one another that they formed a fabric
    equally suited to making clothing as well as blankets. It obviously was
    not merino, nor muslin, nor Scotch cashmere, nor worsted, nor repp, nor
    Chinese satin, nor Orleans cloth, nor alpaca, nor flannel! It was
    “lincolnian felt,” and Lincoln Island had another industry.
</p>
<p>
    Thus with good clothing and thick blankets, the colonists could face the
    winter of 1866-67 without fear.
</p>
<p>
    The severe frost began to really make itself felt toward the 20th of June
    and to his great regret, Pencroff had to suspend the construction of the
    boat which besides he could not finish before the coming spring.
</p>
<p>
    The sailor’s obsession was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor Island
    although Cyrus Smith did not approve of this voyage for curiosity’s sake
    because there evidently was nothing useful to find on this semi-arid and
    deserted rock. A voyage of one hundred fifty miles in a relatively small
    boat on an unknown sea could not but cause him some apprehension. If the
    vessel, once at sea, could not reach Tabor Island and if it could not
    return to Lincoln Island, what would become of it in this Pacific so full
    of disasters?
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith often spoke about this project with Pencroff and he found in
    the sailor a rather strange stubbornness to complete this voyage, a
    stubbornness which he could not explain.
</p>
<p>
    One day the engineer said to him, “My friend, after having said so many
    nice things about Lincoln Island, after having indicated so many times
    that you would be sorry to leave it, you are the first to want to go.”
</p>
<p>
    “To leave it for several days only,” replied Pencroff, “For several days
    only, Mister Cyrus! Time to come and go, to see what is on the islet.”
</p>
<p>
    “But it cannot be as good as Lincoln Island!”
</p>
<p>
    “I know that in advance.”
</p>
<p>
    “Then why venture there?”
</p>
<p>
    “To know what goes on at Tabor Island.”
</p>
<p>
    “But nothing happens there! Nothing can happen there.”
</p>
<p>
    “Who knows?”
</p>
<p>
    “And what if you are caught in some storm?”
</p>
<p>
    “We need not fear that in the fine season,” replied Pencroff. “But,
    Mister Cyrus, since we must think of everything, I ask your permission to
    take Herbert with me on this voyage.”
</p>
<p>
    “Pencroff,” replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor’s
    shoulder, “do you think that we could ever forgive ourselves if some harm
    came to you or to this lad whom chance has made our son?”
</p>
<p>
    “Mister Cyrus,” replied Pencroff with firm confidence, “we will not cause
    you this grief. Besides, we will speak again about this voyage when the
    time will come to make it. Then I imagine, when you will see our boat
    well rigged, with good topsides, when you will see how well it takes to
    the sea, when we will make a tour of our island—because we will do it
    together—I imagine, say I, that you will no longer hesitate to let me
    leave. I will not hide from you that your boat will be a masterpiece.”
</p>
<p>
    “At least say ‘our boat’ Pencroff,” replied the engineer, momentarily
    disarmed.
</p>
<p>
    The conversation ended in this way to commence again at a later time
    without convincing either the sailor or the engineer.
</p>
<p>
    The first snow fell toward the end of the month of June. Previously the
    corral had been well provisioned and daily visits were no longer
    necessary, but it was decided that they would not let a week go by
    without returning there.
</p>
<p>
    The traps were set again and they tried the devices made by Cyrus Smith.
    The whalebones were bent, encased in a sheath of ice, covered with a
    thick layer of blubber and placed at the edge of the forest where animals
    usually passed on their way to the lake.
</p>
<p>
    To the great satisfaction of the engineer, this invention, repeatedly
    used by Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, some wild
    boars, and even a jaguar were taken. They found these animals dead, their
    stomachs pierced by the extended whalebones.
</p>
<p>
    At this time the colonists made their first attempt to communicate with
    their fellow men.
</p>
<p>
    Gideon Spilett had already thought several times either of throwing a
    notice enclosed in a bottle into the sea that the current could perhaps
    carry to some inhabited shore or to entrust it to a pigeon. But how could
    they seriously hope that pigeons or bottles could cross the distance
    which separated the island from land twelve hundred miles away? It was
    pure folly.
</p>
<p>
    But on the 30th of June the capture was made, not without difficulty, of
    an albatross which Herbert’s shot had slightly wounded in the leg. It was
    a magnificent bird of that family of great flyers whose extended wings
    measure ten feet and who can cross seas as large as the Pacific.
</p>
<p>
    Herbert would have wanted to keep this superb bird whose wound had
    promptly healed. He intended to tame it but Gideon Spilett made him to
    understand that they could not neglect this occasion to try to
    correspond, by means of this courier, with the lands of the Pacific.
    Herbert had to yield, because if the albatross had come from some
    inhabited region he would not fail to return there when he was set free.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps, deep down, Gideon Spilett, still a newsman at heart, was not
    sorry to entrust to slim chance an article relating to the adventures of
    the colonists of Lincoln Island. What success the reporter would gain for
    the <i>New York Herald</i> and for the issue which contained the story,
    if ever it reached the address of its editor, the honorable John Bennett!
</p>
<p>
    Gideon Spilett then wrote up a concise article which he put in a strong
    bag of gummed cloth, with an earnest request to anyone who should find
    it, that it be forwarded to the offices of the <i>New York Herald</i>.
    This small sack was attached to the neck of the albatross and not to its
    foot because these birds are in the habit of resting on the surface of
    the sea; then this rapid courier of the skies was set free, and it was
    not without some emotion that the colonists saw it disappear far into the
    haze in the west.

<p>
    “Where is he going?” asked Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    “Toward New Zealand,” replied Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    “Bon Voyage!” cried the sailor who did not expect any great result from
    this method of correspondence.
</p>
<p>
    With the winter, activities were resumed inside Granite House, mending
    the clothes, various preparations among others the making of sails for
    the boat, which were cut from the inexhaustible envelope of the balloon.
</p>
<p>
    During the month of July the cold was intense but they spared neither the
    wood nor the coal. Cyrus Smith had installed a second chimney in the
    great hall and it was there that they passed the long evenings. Chatting
    while they worked, reading when not working, the time passed profitably
    for everyone.
</p>

    <img alt="And the time passed without boredom." src="images/455.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>And the time passed without boredom.</p>
</pic>
<p>
    It was a real satisfaction for the colonists when, in this room well
    lighted by candles, well heated by coal, after a comforting dinner,
    steaming cups filled with elderberry coffee, pipes giving forth a
    fragrant smoke, they heard the tempest roaring outside! It was perfect
    comfort if perfect comfort can ever exist for those who are far from
    their fellow men and without possible communication with them. They
    always chatted about their country, of the friends they had left behind,
    of the grandeur of the American republic whose influence could not but
    increase and Cyrus Smith, who had been very involved with the affairs of
    the Union, vividly interested his listeners with his recitals, his
    perceptions and his predictions.
</p>
<p>
    It happened one day that Gideon Spilett had occasion to say:
</p>
<p>
    “But in the end, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial
    activity in which you predict a continual increase, is it not in danger
    of coming to a complete halt sooner or later?”
</p>
<p>
    “To a halt? And why so?”
</p>
<p>
    “By a lack of coal which can be rightly called the most precious of
    minerals.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, it is the most precious,” replied the engineer, “and it seems to me
    that nature wanted to emphasize this by making the diamond, which is pure
    carbon alone in the crystallized state.”
</p>
<p>
    “You do not wish to say, Mister Cyrus,” retorted Pencroff, “that they
    will burn diamonds in the way coal is burned in furnaces?”
</p>
<p>
    “No, my friend,” replied Cyrus Smith.
</p>
<p>
    “However I insist,” said Gideon Spilett. “You cannot deny that one day
    all the coal will be used up.”
</p>
<p>
    “Oh! The coal deposits are still considerable, and a hundred thousand
    miners removing five million metric tons annually do not come anywhere
    near in exhausting it.”
</p>
<p>
    “With an increase in the consumption of coal,” replied Gideon Spilett,
    “one can predict that these one hundred thousand miners will soon become
    two hundred thousand miners and that the extraction will be doubled.”
</p>
<p>
    “Doubtless; but after the mines of Europe, which new machines will soon
    exploit to greater depths, the mines of America and Australia will
    continue to furnish the needs of industry for a long time.”
</p>
<p>
    “How long?” asked the reporter.
</p>
<p>
    “At least two hundred fifty or three hundred years.”
</p>
<p>
    “That is reassuring for us,” replied Pencroff, “but disturbing for our
    great grand cousins.”
</p>
<p>
    “They will find something else,” said Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    “I hope so,” replied Gideon Spilett, “because without coal, no more
    machines, and without machines, no more railroads, no more steamships, no
    more factories, no more progress for modern life.”
</p>
<p>
    “But what will they find?” asked Pencroff. “Can you imagine, Mister
    Cyrus?”
</p>
<p>
    “Just about, my friend.”
</p>
<p>
    “And what will they burn in the place of coal.”
</p>
<p>
    “Water,” replied Cyrus Smith.
</p>
<p>
    “Water,” cried Pencroff, “water to heat steamships and locomotives, water
    to heat water?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, but water decomposed into its basic elements,” replied Cyrus Smith,
    “decomposed doubtless by electricity which will then become a powerful
    and manageable force, because all great discoveries, by some
    unexplainable law, seem to coincide and become completed at the same
    time. Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as a
    fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen, which compose it, used alone or together,
    will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light and with an
    intensity that coal cannot provide. One day, in the place of coal, the
    coal bunkers of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will be loaded
    with these two compressed gases which will burn in furnaces with an
    enormous heating power. Then there will be nothing to fear. As long as
    this earth is inhabited, it will provide for the needs of its inhabitants
    and neither light nor heat will ever be lacking, nor will the products of
    the vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms. I believe that when the
    coalmines have been exhausted, they will heat and be heated with water.
    Water is the coal of the future.”
</p>
<p>
    “I would like to see that,” said the sailor.
</p>
<p>
    “You came of age too soon, Pencroff,” replied Neb, who intervened in the
    discussion only with these words.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless it was not Neb’s words which ended the conversation but
    Top’s barking which burst out with that strange intonation that had
    already preoccupied the engineer. At the same time, Top began to pace
    around the orifice of the well which opened at the end of the inside
    corridor.
</p>
<p>
    “Why does Top still bark like this?” asked Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    “And Jup growl this way?” added Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unmistaken signs of agitation,
    and strange to say, these two animals appeared to be rather anxious
    instead of irritated.
</p>
<p>
    “It is evident,” said Gideon Spilett, “that this well is in direct
    communication with the sea and that some marine animal comes from time to
    time to breathe at the bottom.”
</p>
<p>
    “It is evident,” replied the sailor, “because there is no other
    explanation to be given... come, quiet, Top,” added Pencroff, turning
    toward the dog, “and you Jup, to your room!”
</p>
<p>
    The ape and the dog were silent. Jup went to bed but Top remained in the
    room and continued to make muffled grunts throughout the evening.
</p>
<p>
    There was no more question about the incident which however, darkened the
    brow of the engineer.
</p>
<p>
    During the rest of the month of July it alternated between rain and
    frost. The temperature did not fall below that of the preceding winter
    and it did not go lower than eight degrees Fahrenheit (13.33° centigrade
    below zero). But if this winter was not colder, nevertheless it was more
    troubled by tempests and windstorms. There still were violent assaults by
    the sea which once again jeopardized the Chimneys. It seemed that some
    violent current, provoked by some underseas commotion, lifted these
    monstrous waves and threw them against the wall of Granite House.
</p>
<p>
    When the colonists, leaning against their windows, saw these enormous
    masses of water breaking under their eyes, they could not but admire the
    magnificent spectacle of this impotent fury of the ocean. The waves
    rebounded as a dazzling foam, the beach completely disappeared under this
    angry deluge, and the wall seemed to emerge from the sea itself, whose
    sprays rose to a height of over one hundred feet.
</p>
<p>
    During these storms it was difficult to venture on the island’s trails,
    even dangerous, because falling trees were frequent. The colonists
    however did not let a week pass without visiting the corral. Fortunately,
    this enclosure, sheltered by the southern buttress of Mount Franklin, did
    not suffer much from the violences of the storm which spared the trees,
    the sheds and the fence. But the poultry yard, built on Grand View
    Plateau, and consequently directly exposed to the winds from the east,
    was subjected to rather considerable damage. The pigeon house was twice
    broken up and the fence was also damaged. They had to rebuild everything
    in a more sturdy manner because they could clearly see that Lincoln
    Island was situated in the worst waters of the Pacific. It really seemed
    that it formed the central point of a vast cyclone which whipped about
    like a spinning top. Only here it was the top that was stationary and the
    whip that turned round.
</p>
<p>
    During the first week of the month of August the squalls abated little by
    little and the atmosphere recovered the calm that it seemed to have lost
    forever. With the calm the temperature dropped, the frost returned very
    vividly and the thermometer column fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit below
    zero (22° centigrade below freezing).
</p>
<p>
    On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been planned for several days
    was made to the southeast of the island toward Tadorn Marsh. The hunters
    were tempted by the waterfowl which had established their winter quarters
    there. Wild duck, snipe, pintail, teal and grebe abounded there and it
    was decided that a day would be devoted for an expedition against these
    birds.
</p>
<p>
    Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroff and Neb also took part
    in the expedition. Only Cyrus Smith, on the pretext of some work, did not
    join them and remained at Granite House.
</p>
<p>
    The hunters took the Port Balloon Road to reach the marshes after having
    promised to return in the evening. Top and Jup accompanied them. After
    they passed over the Mercy Bridge, the engineer raised it and returned
    with the thought of putting into execution a project for which he wanted
    to be alone.
</p>
<p>
    Now this project was to minutely explore the inside of the well whose
    orifice opened at the level of Granite House and which communicated with
    the sea since formerly it had served as a passage for the waters of the
    lake.
</p>
<p>
    Why did Top pace so often around this orifice? Why these strange barks
    when a sort of uneasiness drove him toward the well? Why did Jup join Top
    in a sort of common anxiety? Did this well have other branches in
    vertical communication with the sea? Did it reach out to other portions
    of the island? This Cyrus Smith wanted to know and to be the first to
    know. He therefore resolved to attempt an exploration of the well during
    the absence of his companions and the occasion presented itself for doing
    it.
</p>
<p>
    It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by using the cord ladder
    that had not been in service since the installation of the elevator and
    whose length was sufficient. This is what the engineer did. He dragged
    the ladder up to the opening, whose diameter measured about six feet and
    he let it unroll after having secured it firmly at its upper end. Then,
    lighting a lantern, taking a revolver and putting a cutlass into his
    belt, he began to descend the first rungs. The wall was solid throughout;
    but there were several projections of rock here and there and by means of
    these projections it would have been possible for an agile being to climb
    up to the well’s opening.
</p>
<p>
    The engineer made a mental note of this; but on casting his lantern on
    these projections he could find no footprint, nor any fracture which
    would make him think that it had been used as a staircase either recently
    or in the past.
</p>
<p>
    Cyrus Smith descended deeper, lighting up all the points of the wall.
</p>
<p>
    He saw nothing suspicious there.
</p>
<pic>
    <img alt="He saw nothing suspicious there." src="images/462.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>He saw nothing suspicious there.</p>
</pic>
<p>
    When the engineer reached the last rungs he felt the surface of the water
    which was then perfectly calm. Neither at this level nor at any other
    part of the well was there any lateral corridor which could branch out to
    the interior of this solid mass. The wall, which Cyrus Smith struck with
    the handle of his cutlass, sounded solid. It was a compact granite
    through which no living being could blaze a passage. To get to the bottom
    of the well and then ascend to the orifice it was necessary to pass
    through the always submerged channel which put it in communication with
    the sea via the rocky subsoil under the beach, and this was possible only
    for marine animals. As to the question of knowing where the channel ran,
    at what point on the shore and at what depth under the waves, that could
    not be determined.
</p>
<p>
    Having completed his exploration, Cyrus Smith then climbed back up, drew
    up the ladder, covered the opening of the well and returned, full of
    thoughts, to the large hall of Granite House, saying to himself,
</p>
<p>
    “I have seen nothing, yet there is something there.”
