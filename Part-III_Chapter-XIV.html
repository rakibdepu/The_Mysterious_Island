    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">Three</b> years had passed since the prisoners from
      Richmond had fled and at all times during these three years they spoke of
      their country, always present in their thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no doubt that the Civil War was now at an end and it seemed
      impossible to them that the just cause of the North had not been
      victorious. But what were the events of this terrible war? How much blood
      had been spilled? Which of their friends had succumbed in battle? They
      often spoke of these things, still without knowing when they would see
      their country again. To return there if only for a few days, to renew
      social ties with the inhabited world, to establish communication between
      their native land and their island, to pass the longest, perhaps the best
      part of their lives in this colony that they had founded and which would
      then become a metropolis, was this then an unrealistic dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were only two ways to realize this dream: either a vessel would
      show itself some day in the waters of Lincoln Island or the colonists
      would themselves construct a boat large enough to take to sea and reach
      the nearest land.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unless,” said Pencroff, “our genie himself furnishes us with the means
      to repatriate ourselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And truly if someone told Pencroff and Neb that a vessel of three hundred
      tons was waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would
      not even have shown any surprise. In their state of mind they expected
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cyrus Smith, being less confident, advised them to return to reality
      by proposing that they construct a boat, a truly urgent task, since they
      must bring a document to Tabor Island as soon as possible which would
      indicate Ayrton’s new residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bonadventure no longer existed. Six months at least would be
      necessary for the construction of a new vessel. Now, with winter coming
      on, the voyage could not be made before next spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We therefore have time to prepare for the fine season,” said the
      engineer, who chatted about these things with Pencroff. “I therefore
      think, my friend, that since we have to make a boat again, it would be
      best to give it larger dimensions. The arrival of the Scotch yacht at
      Lincoln Island is very problematic. Perhaps it even came in the last few
      months and left again after having vainly looked for some trace of
      Ayrton. Would it not therefore be appropriate to construct a vessel
      which, if need be, could carry us to the Polynesian archipelagoes or to
      New Zealand? What do you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor, “I think that you are just
      as capable of making a large boat as a small one. Neither the wood nor
      the tools are lacking. It is only a question of time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how much time would be required for the construction of a vessel of
      two hundred fifty to three hundred tons?” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Seven or eight months at least,” replied Pencroff. “But let’s not forget
      that when winter comes, wood is difficult to work in the frost. Let’s
      therefore count on a few idle weeks and if our boat is ready by next
      November, we should consider ourselves lucky.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied Cyrus Smith, “that will be the best time to undertake a
      crossing of some importance either to Tabor Island or to a further land.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor, “make your plans, the
      workers are ready and I imagine that Ayrton will lend us a helping hand
      in these circumstances.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were consulted and approved of the engineer’s project and
      in truth, it was the best thing to do. It is true that the construction
      of a vessel of two to three hundred tons was a large undertaking but the
      colonists had a confidence in themselves justified by the successes
      already obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith therefore occupied himself with making the plans for the
      vessel. During this time, his companions were employed in felling and
      carting the trees which would provide the curved wood, the ribs and the
      planking. It was the Forest of the Far West which gave the best species
      of oaks and elms. They profited from the path already made at the time of
      the last excursion to open a practical route which took the name of Route
      of the Far West. The trees were transported to the Chimneys where a
      shipyard was established. As to the route in question, it was traced out
      capriciously. It was a little the choice of wood which determined the
      path but it facilitated access to a large portion of Serpentine
      Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was important that the wood be promptly cut up and sawed because they
      could not use it while it was still green and time must be left for it to
      harden. The carpenters therefore worked with ardor during the month of
      April, which was troubled only by a few rather violent equinoxial
      windstorms. Master Jup helped them skillfully either by climbing to the
      top of a tree in order to attach the felling ropes or by using his robust
      shoulders to carry the lopped off trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this wood was piled up under a large shed which was constructed
      near the Chimneys and there it remained until it would be put to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month of April was rather fine, as the month of October often is in
      the northern zone. At the same time, the agricultural work was actively
      carried on and soon all trace of the devastation had disappeared from
      Grand View Plateau. The mill was rebuilt and new buildings rose where the
      poultry yard had been. It seemed necessary to construct it to larger
      dimensions because the avian population had increased considerably. The
      stables now housed five onagers, four who were vigorous and well trained
      for harness or riding, and a young one recently born. The colony’s
      equipment was increased with a plow. The onagers were employed to pull
      it, like true oxen from Yorkshire or from Kentucky. Each of the colonists
      shared in the work and no hands were idle. The laborers were in fine
      health and in fine humor. They animated the evenings at Granite House by
      forming a thousand plans for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that Ayrton completely shared in the common
      existence and there no longer was any question about his going to live at
      the corral. Nevertheless he was always sad, not very communicative, and
      joined in the work rather than in the pleasures of his companions. But he
      was a rugged laborer at his tasks, vigorous, skilful, ingenious and
      intelligent. He was esteemed and loved by everyone and he could not but
      be aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corral, however, was not abandoned. Every two days one of the
      colonists, taking the cart or riding one of the onagers, went to look
      after the flock of sheep or goats and carry back milk for Neb’s pantry.
      At the same time, these excursions were occasions for hunting. Herbert
      and Gideon Spilett—with Top in front—took to the road to the corral more
      often than any of their companions, and with their excellent weapons,
      capybara, agouti, kangaroo, wild boar and wild pig for the large game and
      duck, grouse, heath fowl, jacamar and snipe for the small game, were
      never lacking at home. The products of the warren, those of the oyster
      bed, some turtles which were prized, a new catch of excellent salmon
      which still came to swarm in the waters of the Mercy, the vegetables from
      Grand View Plateau, the natural fruits from the forest, it was riches
      upon riches and Neb, the master cook, could barely cope with storing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that the telegraphic wire thrown between the
      corral and Granite House was repaired and that it was used whenever one
      or another of the colonists found himself at the corral and judged it
      necessary to pass the night there. Besides, the island was secure now and
      no aggression was to be feared—at least on the part of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      However what had happened once could happen again. A descent of pirates
      and even of escaped convicts was always to be feared. It was possible
      that some companions and accomplices of Bob Harvey, still detained at
      Norfolk, were in on his secret plans and would attempt to imitate him.
      The colonists examined the approaches to the island every day and their
      telescope swept the large horizon which enclosed Union Bay and Washington
      Bay. When they went to the corral, they examined with no less care the
      western part of the ocean and by climbing the buttress, their gaze could
      cover a rather large sector of the western horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing suspicious appeared but still they must always be on their guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening the engineer told his friends about his plans to fortify the
      corral. It seemed prudent to him to increase the height of the palisaded
      enclosure and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse in which, if need be,
      they could hold out against an enemy troop. Granite House could be
      considered impregnable by its very position. The corral with its
      structures, its reserves and the animals it enclosed, would always be the
      objective of pirates, whoever they were, who would land on the island,
      and if the colonists were forced to enclose themselves there, they could
      hold out without being at a disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a project to ripen because they were forced to hold off its
      execution until the coming spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the 15th of May, the keel of the new vessel stretched out over the
      shipyard and soon the stem and the sternpost, squared at each end, were
      erected almost perpendicularly. This keel, of good oak, measured one
      hundred ten feet in length, giving the main beam a width of twenty five
      feet. But this was all the carpenters could do before the arrival of the
      frost and the bad weather. During the following week they put the first
      rear frames in place; then they had to suspend work.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the final days of the month the weather was very bad. The wind
      blew from the east, at times with the violence of a storm. The engineer
      had some uneasiness about the sheds at the shipyard—which, by the way,
      they could not establish at any other place near Granite House—because
      the islet protected the shore only imperfectly against the furies of the
      sea and during major storms the waves beat directly at the foot of the
      granite wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind blew more
      often from the southeast and under these conditions the Granite House
      shore was completely protected by the salient at Flotsom Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff and Ayrton, the two most zealous workers on the new boat,
      pursued their labors as long as they could. They were not men to be
      inconvenienced by the wind which twisted their hair, nor by the rain
      which seemed to penetrate to their very bones, and a blow from a hammer
      is worth as much in bad as in good weather. But when a very vivid frost
      succeeded this wet period, the wood, whose fibers acquired the hardness
      of iron, became extremely difficult to work and around the 10th of June
      they had to definitely abandon the construction of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions noticed that the temperature was severe
      during the winters at Lincoln Island. The cold was comparable to that
      felt in the New England States, situated at very nearly the same distance
      from the equator. If, in the northern hemisphere, or at least in the part
      occupied by Canada and the north of the United States, this phenomenon
      can be explained by the smooth topography of the territories which border
      on the pole so that no obstructions oppose the wintry winds from the
      extreme north, no such explanation would suffice here as regards to
      Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One can even observe,” Cyrus Smith said one day to his companions, “that
      at similar latitudes, islands and coastal regions are less subject to the
      cold than Mediterranean countries. I have often heard it said that the
      winters of Lombardy, for example, are more vigorous than those of
      Scotland, which is due to the fact that during the winter, the sea
      restores the heat that it has received during the summer. Islands are in
      the best position to benefit from this restitution.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But then, Mister Cyrus,” asked Herbert, “why does Lincoln Island escape
      the usual rule?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is difficult to explain,” replied the engineer. “However I am
      inclined to admit that this singularity is due to the position of the
      island in the southern hemisphere which as you know, my child, is colder
      than the northern hemisphere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact”, said Herbert, “floating ice is encountered under lower
      latitudes in the South Pacific than in the north.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is true,” replied Pencroff, “and when I worked as a whaler, I saw
      icebergs at Cape Horn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That could then perhaps explain,” said Gideon Spilett, “the rigorous
      cold which strikes Lincoln Island, because of the nearby ice floes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact, your opinion is very admissible, my dear Spilett,” replied
      Cyrus Smith, “and it is evident that we owe our rigorous winters to the
      proximity of the ice pack. I will also note a physical cause which
      renders the southern hemisphere colder than the northern hemisphere. In
      fact, since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere in the summer, it is
      necessarily further during the winter. This therefore explains the
      extremes of temperature in two senses and if we find the winters very
      cold at Lincoln Island, let us not forget that the summers, on the
      contrary, are very warm.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But why then, Mister Smith, if you please,” asked Pencroff frowning,
      “why is our hemisphere, as you said, treated so badly? That isn’t fair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Friend Pencroff,” replied the engineer smiling, “fair or not, we must
      submit to the situation, and this is why this particularity comes about.
      The earth does not describe a circle around the sun but rather an
      ellipse, according to the laws of rational mechanics. The sun occupies
      one of the foci of the ellipse. As a consequence, at a certain point in
      its orbit, the earth is at its apogee, that is to say at its greatest
      distance from the sun, and at another point, its perigee, it is at its
      shortest distance. Now it so happens that it is precisely during the
      winter in the southern countries that the earth is at its greatest
      distance from the sun and consequently in the condition required for
      these regions to be subject to a colder frost. Nothing can be done about
      that, Pencroff, and men, however learned they may be, will never be able
      to change the cosmological order established by God Himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless,” added Pencroff, who was slow to resign himself, “the
      world is well informed! What a big book one could make, Mister Cyrus,
      with all that is known.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what a still larger book with what is not known,” replied Cyrus
      Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, for one reason or another, the month of June again brought frost
      with its usual violence and the colonists were often confined to Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! This imprisonment seemed to be hard on everyone and perhaps more
      particularly on Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “See here,” he said one day to Neb, “by the act of a notary, I would give
      you all the inheritances that would come to me one day if you would be a
      good fellow and go, never mind where, and subscribe to any journal
      whatsoever. Decidedly, what I miss most for my well being is to know
      every morning what has happened the previous day besides here.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/774.jpg" border="1" width="325" height="460" alt=

        <b>“See here,” said one day Gideon Spillet to Neb...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Neb laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My word,” he replied, “my daily tasks are all that concern me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that, inside or outside, there was no lack of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colony of Lincoln Island then found itself at the height of its
      prosperity and three years of work had made it such. The incident of the
      destroyed brig had been a new source of riches. Without mentioning the
      complete rigging which would be used for the vessel under construction,
      utensils and tools of all sorts, arms and munitions, clothing and
      instruments now crowded the storerooms of Granite House. It was no longer
      even necessary to have recourse to making the crude felt material. If the
      colonists had suffered from the cold during their first winter, now the
      bad season could come without the need to dread its rigors. Linen was
      also abundant and besides, they took good care of it. From sodium
      chloride, which is nothing more than sea salt, Cyrus Smith had easily
      extracted the soda and the chlorine. The soda, which was easy to
      transformed into sodium carbonate, and the chlorine which was made into
      bleaching powder, was employed for many domestic uses in particular for
      bleaching linen. Moreover, they had wash days no more than four times a
      year, as was formerly practiced by families of long ago, and one may be
      permitted to add that Pencroff and Gideon Spilett, while waiting for the
      postman to bring him his journal, showed themselves to be distinguished
      launderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed the winter months, June, July and August. They were very
      rigorous and the average temperature reading did not give more than 8°F
      (13.33°C below zero). It was less than the temperature of the preceding
      winter. What warm fires burned incessantly in the Granite House
      fireplaces, with the smoke making long black stripes on the granite
      walls. They spared no fuel, which could be found in a natural state a
      short distance away. Besides, the excess from the wood intended for the
      construction of the vessel allowed them to economize the coal whose
      transportation was more troublesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men and animals were in good health. It was agreed that Master Jup was a
      little chilly. That was perhaps his only shortcoming and they had to make
      him a well padded dressing gown. But with such domesticity, skill, zeal,
      strength, discretion and silence, they could rightly propose him as a
      model for all his biped colleagues of the old and new worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After all,” said Pencroff, “when someone has four hands to work with, we
      can expect him to find work more suitable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as a matter of fact, the intelligent quadrumane did it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the seven months which had passed since the last search conducted
      around the mountain and during the month of September, which brought back
      the fine weather, there was no question about the genie of the island.
      His action did not manifest itself in any event. It is true that it would
      have been useless, since no incident occurred to put the colonists in a
      troublesome position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith even observed that if, by chance, communications between the
      stranger and the hosts of Granite House had ever been established through
      the granite mass, and if Top’s instincts indicated forebodings, so to
      speak, it was no longer so during this period. The dog’s growling had
      ceased completely, as well as the orang’s uneasiness. The two
      friends—because such they were—no longer prowled around the orifice of
      the inside well and they did not bark nor groan in this strange way which
      had put the engineer on the alert at the beginning. But could he be sure
      that the last word had been said about this riddle and that they would
      never have the answer? Could he say that some combination of events would
      not occur to bring the mysterious personage into action? Who could tell
      what was in store for the future?
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally winter ended; but an event whose consequences could be serious,
      occurred precisely during the first days which marked the return of
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 7th of September, Cyrus Smith, looking at the top of Mount
      Franklin, saw smoke twirling above the crater with its first vapors
      projecting into the atmosphere.
