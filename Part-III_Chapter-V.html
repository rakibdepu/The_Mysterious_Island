      <b class="cap">So</b> then, everything was explained by the submarine
      explosion of this torpedo. Cyrus Smith, who during the war of the Union
      had had occasion to experiment with these terrible engines of
      destruction, was not mistaken. It was under the action of this cylinder,
      loaded with an explosive substance, nitroglycerin, picrate or other
      material of the same nature, that the water of the channel rose like a
      waterspout. The brig was struck from below and foundered instantly. It
      was impossible to refloat the brig because its hull had been subjected to
      considerable damage. The <i>Speedy</i> had not been able to resist a
      torpedo which could destroy an armored frigate as easily as a simple
      fishing boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! everything was explained, everything... except the presence of this
      torpedo in the waters of the channel!
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friends,” Cyrus Smith then said, “we can no longer doubt the presence
      of a mysterious being, a castaway like ourselves perhaps, abandoned on
      our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be brought up to date
      on the strange events that have occurred during these two years. Who is
      this unknown benefactor whose intervention, fortunately for us, is
      manifested in so many ways? I cannot imagine him. What interest does he
      have in acting so and in concealing himself after rendering these
      services? I do not understand it. But these services are none the less
      real and such that only a man possessing prodigious power could have
      rendered them for us. Ayrton is just as indebted to him as we are,
      because it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall of
      the balloon, it was evidently he who wrote the document, who put this
      bottle along the route of the channel which told us of our companion’s
      situation. I will add that this case, so conveniently containing
      everything that we needed, was brought to and stranded at Flotsom Point
      by him; that it was he who lighted the fire placed on the heights of the
      island which permitted you to reach land; that it was he who fired the
      lead bullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who placed
      this torpedo in the channel which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all
      these inexplicable events, which we have not been able to render an
      account of, they are due to this mysterious being. Thus whoever he is,
      castaway or exile on this island, we would be ingrates if we thought
      ourselves free of any obligation toward him. We have contracted a debt
      and I hope that we will pay it one day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right in speaking this way, my dear Cyrus,” replied Gideon
      Spilett. “Yes, there is a being, almost all powerful, hidden in some part
      of the island, whose influence has been strangely useful for our colony.
      I will add that this stranger seems to have means of action which border
      on the supernatural, if the supernatural is acceptable to the events of
      practical life. Is it he who is in secret communication with us by means
      of the well in Granite House and does he therefore know all our plans?
      Was it he who put this bottle within our reach when the canoe made its
      first sea excursion? Was it he who threw Top out of the waters of the
      lake and gave the mortal wound to the dugong? Was it he, as we are all
      led to believe, who saved you from the waves, Cyrus, and under
      circumstances in which any other man could not have acted? If it is he,
      then he possesses a power which renders him master of the elements.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter’s observation was justified and everyone agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Cyrus Smith, “if we no longer doubt the intervention of a
      human being, I agree that he has a means of action which are outside that
      available to humanity. That is also a mystery, but if we discover the
      man, the mystery will also be solved. The question then is this: should
      we respect the privacy of this generous being or should we do everything
      to find him? What is your opinion in this respect?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My opinion,” replied Pencroff, “is that whoever he is, he is a brave man
      and he has my esteem.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is so,” replied Cyrus Smith, “but that is not an answer, Pencroff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My master,” Neb then said, “my opinion is that we can search as much as
      we wish for the gentleman in question but we will not find him until it
      pleases him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What you say, Neb, is not foolish,” replied Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I agree with Neb,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but that is no reason for
      not trying. Whether we find or do not find this mysterious being, we will
      at least have done our duty toward him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you, my child, give us your opinion,” said the engineer, turning
      toward Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” shouted Herbert, whose look became animated, “I would like to thank
      him. It was he who first saved you and who saved us afterwards.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t despair, my lad,” retorted Pencroff, “and I also, and all of us! I
      am not curious but I would give one of my eyes to see this particular
      person face to face. It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall,
      strong, with a fine beard, hair like rays, and that he must lie on the
      clouds with a large ball in his hand!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Pencroff,” replied Gideon Spilett, “that is the portrait of God, the
      Father, that you have given us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Possibly, Mister Spilett,” replied the sailor, “but that is how I
      visualize him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you, Ayrton?” asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Smith,” replied Ayrton, “I can hardly give you my advice on this
      matter. What you will do will be fine with me. When you wish me to join
      your search, I will be ready to follow you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you, Ayrton,” replied Cyrus Smith, “but I would like a more
      direct response to the question which I have asked. You are our
      companion; several times already you have shown your devotion to us and,
      like everyone here, you should be consulted when we are making some
      important decision. Speak then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Smith,” replied Ayrton, “I think that we should do everything to
      find this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone? Perhaps he suffers?
      Perhaps there is a life to renew? I also, as you have said, owe him a
      debt. It was he, it could only be he who came to Tabor Island, who found
      there this wretch that you have come to know, who made you aware that
      there was an unfortunate to save... It is therefore thanks to him that I
      have become a man once again. No, I will never forget him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is decided,” Cyrus Smith then said. “We will begin our search as soon
      as possible. We will not leave any part of the island unexplored. We will
      pry into its most secret retreats and I hope that our unknown friend will
      pardon our intentions.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days the colonists were employed in hay making and
      harvesting. Before putting into execution their project to explore the
      still unknown parts of the island, they wanted to complete all
      indispensable tasks. It was also the season for harvesting the various
      vegetables grown from the Tabor Island plants. Everything was stored and
      fortunately there was no lack of space at Granite House where they could
      put all the riches of the island. The products of the colony were there,
      methodically arranged and in a secure place, protected, we can be sure,
      as much from beasts as from men. No dampness was to be feared in the
      midst of this thick mass of granite. Several natural excavations situated
      in the upper passageway were enlarged and widened either with the pickaxe
      or with the mine and Granite House thus became a general warehouse
      containing the provisions, the munitions, the tools and the spare
      utensils, in a word all the material of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the cannons from the brig, they were fine pieces cast in steel
      which, at Pencroff’s urging, were hoisted by means of winding tackle and
      cranes to the very level of Granite House; recesses were made in the
      windows and soon one could see the shining muzzles of the cannons through
      the granite wall. From this height, these muzzles truly commanded all of
      Union Bay. It was like a miniature Gibraltar and any vessel which would
      moor in sight of the islet would be inevitably exposed to the fire from
      this aerial battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Cyrus,” Pencroff said one day,—it was the 8th of November—“now
      that this armament is in place, we should try our pieces for range.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you believe that this is useful?” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without it, how can we know to
      what distance we can send one of these fine balls with which we are
      provided?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us try it then, Pencroff,” replied the engineer. “Nevertheless I
      think that we should try to use not ordinary powder whose supply I would
      like to leave intact, but pyroxylin which we will never lack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can these cannons withstand the explosion of pyroxylin?” asked the
      reporter, who was no less desirous than Pencroff to try out the Granite
      House artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so. Besides,” added the engineer, “we will proceed carefully.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer had reason to believe that these cannons were of excellent
      manufacture as he could plainly see. Made with forged steel and breech
      loaded, they could, as a result, withstand a considerable charge and
      consequently have an enormous range. In fact, from the practical point of
      view, the trajectory described by the ball should be as accurate as
      possible and this accuracy can only be obtained if the projectile is
      given a very large muzzle velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Cyrus Smith to his companions, “the muzzle velocity is in
      proportion to the amount of powder used. In the manufacture of these
      pieces, the question reduces itself to using the strongest possible
      metal, and steel is incontestably the strongest of all metals. I
      therefore have reason to believe that our cannons will withstand the
      expansion of the pyroxylin gases without danger and will give excellent
      results.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will be more certain of that when we try it,” replied Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that the four cannons were in perfect condition.
      After they had been salvaged from the water, the sailor had given himself
      the task of polishing them conscientiously. What hours he spent rubbing
      them, lubricating them, cleaning the obturator mechanism, the locking
      bolt and the pressure screw! And now these pieces were as brilliant as if
      they had been on board a frigate of the United States Navy.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/662.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>What hours he spent rubbing them!</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      On this day then, in the presence of all the personnel of the colony,
      Master Jup and Top included, the four cannons were tried in turn. They
      loaded them with pyroxylin, taking account of its explosive power which,
      as has been said, is quadruple that of ordinary powder; the projectile
      that they would use was cylindro-conical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff, holding the fuze cord, was ready to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sign from Cyrus Smith, this was done. The ball, directed toward the
      ocean, passed over the islet and was lost at sea at a distance that they
      could not determine accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second cannon was pointed toward the extreme rocks at Flotsom Point
      and the projectile, striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite
      House, made it fly into splinters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Herbert who had aimed the cannon and fired it and he was full of
      pride over the test. Only Pencroff was even prouder, for the honor of
      this shot belonged to his dear child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third projectile, thrown this time over the dunes which formed the
      upper coast of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of at least four
      miles; then after having ricocheted, it lost itself at sea in a cloudy
      spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the fourth piece, Cyrus Smith overloaded it a bit, in order to test
      it at maximum range. Everyone took cover in case it exploded. The fuze
      was ignited with a long cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violent detonation was heard but the piece held. Running to the window
      the colonists could see the projectile chip the rocks of Cape Mandible at
      nearly five miles from Granite House and disappear into Shark Gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Mister Cyrus,” shouted Pencroff, whose hurrahs rivaled the
      detonations produced, “what do you think of our battery? All the pirates
      of the Pacific have only to present themselves in front of Granite House.
      Now not one will land without our permission.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Believe me, Pencroff,” replied the engineer, “it would be better not to
      have the experience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the same subject,” replied the sailor, “what shall we do with the six
      rascals who are roaming the island? Will we let them overrun our forests,
      our fields and our prairies? Pirates like these are real jaguars and it
      seems to me that we should not hesitate to treat them as such. What do
      you think Ayrton?” said Pencroff, turning to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Ayrton hesitated to reply and Cyrus Smith regretted that
      Pencroff had been a little thoughtless in asking this question. He was
      very moved when Ayrton replied in a humble tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have been one of these jaguars, Mister Pencroff, and I do not have the
      right to speak...”
    </p>
    <p>
      And he quietly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Devilish beast that I am,” he shouted. “Poor Ayrton! He nevertheless has
      the right to speak as much as anyone here...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Gideon Spilett, “but his reserve does him honor and we must
      respect this feeling that he has about his sad past.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Agreed, Mister Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I won’t do that again. I
      would rather devour my tongue than cause Ayrton any sorrow. But let us
      return to the question. It seems to me that these bandits have no right
      to any pity and that we must rid the island of them as soon as possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that really your opinion, Pencroff?” asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is definitely my opinion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And before pursuing them without mercy would you not wait until they had
      done something hostile against us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Isn’t what they have already done sufficient?” asked Pencroff, who could
      not understand these hesitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They could take on other sentiments,” said Cyrus Smith, “and perhaps
      repent...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Repent, they!” shouted the sailor, raising his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pencroff, think of Ayrton!” Herbert then said, taking the sailor’s hand.
      “He became an honest man again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff looked at his companions from one to the other. He had not
      thought that his proposal would have encountered any hesitation
      whatsoever. His rough nature could not admit that they compromise with
      the rascals who had landed on the island, the accomplices of Bob Harvey,
      the assassins of the <i>Speedy</i>’s crew, and he looked upon them as
      wild beasts whom he must destroy without hesitation and without remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come now!” he said. “I have everyone against me. You want to deal
      generously with these rascals! So be it. May we not regret it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What danger do we run,” said Herbert, “if we take care to keep up our
      guard?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hm!” said the reporter, who had not spoken much. “They are six and well
      armed. If each of them lay in wait in a corner and fired on one of us
      they would soon be masters of the colony.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why haven’t they done so?” replied Herbert. “Doubtless because it is not
      in their interest to do so. Besides, we are also six.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good! good!” replied Pencroff, whom no amount of reasoning could
      convince. “Let us allow these worthy men to attend to their little
      occupations and let us think no more about them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, Pencroff,” said Neb. “You are not as wicked as all that. If one of
      these unfortunates were here, in front of you, in easy range of your gun,
      wouldn’t you fire over...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would fire on him as if he were a mad dog, Neb,” replied Pencroff
      coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pencroff,” the engineer then said, “you have often shown much deference
      to my opinion. Won’t you in this circumstance yield to me again?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will do as you wish, Mister Smith,” replied the sailor, who was not
      convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then, let us wait, and attack only if we are attacked.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conduct with respect to the pirates was thus decided even though
      Pencroff could foresee no good result. They would not attack them but
      they would remain on guard. After all, the island was large and fertile.
      If some sentiment of honesty remained in the depths of their souls, these
      wretches could perhaps reform. Under the conditions in which they had to
      live, was it not in their interest to start a new life? In any case,
      humanity required that they wait. Perhaps the colonists no longer could
      come and go as before without caution. Until then they had had to guard
      only against wild animals, and now six convicts, perhaps of the worst
      kind, were roaming their island. It was doubtless serious and for less
      brave men it would have been lost security.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter! For the present the colonists were right contrary to Pencroff.
      Would they be right in the future? That remained to be seen.
