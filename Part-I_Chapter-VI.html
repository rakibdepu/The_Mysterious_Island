      <b class="cap">The</b> inventory of the objects possessed by these
      castaways from the sky, thrown on a coast that appeared to be
      uninhabited, could be promptly established.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had nothing except for the clothes on their backs at the moment of
      the catastrophe. We should however mention a notebook and a watch that
      Gideon Spilett had saved inadvertently no doubt, but not a weapon, not a
      tool, not even a pocket knife. The balloon passengers had thrown
      everything overboard in order to lighten it. The imaginary heros of
      Daniel de Foe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal, castaways at
      Juan-Fernandez or the archipelago of Auckland, never found themselves so
      absolutely helpless. They had abundant resources drawn from their
      stranded vessels whether in grain, animals, tools, munitions, or else
      some wreckage had reached the shore which allowed them to provide for the
      primary needs of life. At the start they did not find themselves
      absolutely disarmed in the face of nature. But here, no instrument
      whatsoever, not a utensil. Nothing, they must obtain everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      If however, Cyrus Smith had been with them, if the engineer had been able
      to put his practical science, his inventive spirit to the service of this
      situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost. Alas! They could
      not count on seeing Cyrus Smith again. The castaways could depend on no
      one but themselves and on Providence who never abandons those whose faith
      is sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before all else should they settle themselves on this part of the
      shore without trying to find out what continent it belonged to, if it was
      inhabited or if this coast was only the beach of a deserted island?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an important question to be resolved with the briefest delay. The
      measures to be taken would depend on the answer. However it was
      Pencroff’s advice that it would be better to wait several days before
      undertaking an exploration. In fact it was necessary to prepare
      provisions and to obtain food more substantial than only eggs and
      mollusks. The explorers, having endured long fatigue, without a shelter
      for sleeping, would have to refresh themselves before doing anything
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chimneys offered a sufficient retreat for the time being. The fire
      was lit and it would be easy to save the cinders. For the moment there
      was no lack of mollusks and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. They
      would surely find the means to kill some of these pigeons that flew about
      by the hundreds at the crest of the plateau using sticks or stones.
      Perhaps the trees of the nearby forest would give them edible fruit?
      Finally sweet water was there. It was therefore agreed that for the next
      few days they would remain at the Chimneys in order to prepare there for
      an exploration either of the coastline or of the interior of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan particularly suited Neb. As stubborn in his ideas as in his
      forebodings he was in no hurry to leave this part of the coast, the scene
      of the catastrophe. He did not believe, he did not want to believe that
      Cyrus Smith was lost. No, it didn’t seem possible that such a man met his
      end in so vulgar a fashion, carried off by a wave, drowned in the sea
      only a few hundred feet from shore. As long as the waves had not thrown
      up the body of the engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his
      own eyes, touched with his own hands the corpse of his master, he would
      not believe that he was dead. And this idea took root in his obstinate
      heart more than ever. Illusion perhaps but a respected illusion
      nevertheless which the sailor did not wish to destroy. For him there was
      no more hope and the engineer had indeed perished in the waves but with
      Neb there was nothing to discuss. He was like a dog that will not leave
      the place where his master died and his grief was such that he probably
      would not survive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of March 26th, at dawn, Neb went back to the shore in a
      northerly direction, returning to where the sea had doubtless closed in
      on the unfortunate Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast on this day was composed only of pigeon eggs and of lithodomes.
      Herbert had found some salt left behind in the crevices of the rocks by
      evaporation and this mineral substance was put to good use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal finished, Pencroff asked the reporter if he wanted to accompany
      them to the forest where Herbert and he would try to hunt. However, on
      further reflection it was decided that someone should stay behind to look
      after the fire and in the unlikely event that Neb would need help. The
      reporter would therefore stay behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the hunt, Herbert,” said the sailor. “We will find our munitions
      along the way and we will fire our guns in the forest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when they were about to leave, Herbert noted that since they had no
      tinder it would perhaps be prudent to replace it with another substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Burnt linen,” replied the lad. “In a pinch it can serve as tinder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor found that this advice made sense except that it was
      inconvenient since it meant the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief.
      Nevertheless it was worth the trouble and so a piece of Pencroff’s large
      square handkerchief was soon reduced to a half burnt rag. This
      inflammable material was placed in the central chamber at the bottom of a
      small cavity in a rock completely sheltered from wind and dampness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then nine o’clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and
      the wind blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroff turned the corner
      of the Chimneys not without having thrown a glance at the smoke which was
      twirling around from the rocks; then they went up the left bank of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the forest, Pencroff first broke off two sturdy branches
      which he transformed into sticks and which Herbert ground down to a point
      on a rock. Ah! If they only had a knife! Then the two hunters advanced
      among the tall grass following the riverbank. On leaving the bend that
      changed its course to the southwest, the river grew narrower little by
      little and its banks formed a channel enclosed by a double arc of trees.
      Pencroff, not wanting to get lost, resolved to follow the water’s course
      which would always return him to his starting point. But the bank was not
      without several obstacles, here trees whose flexible branches bent to the
      level of the water, there creepers or thorn bushes which they had to
      break with their sticks. Often Herbert glided among the broken stumps
      with the agility of a young cat and he disappeared into the brushwood.
      But Pencroff recalled him immediately begging him not to go too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the sailor carefully noted the nature of the surroundings. On
      the left bank the soil was level and rose imperceptibly toward the
      interior. Sometimes moist, it then took on a marshy appearance.
      Everywhere they felt an underground network of streams which, by some
      subterranean fault, flowed toward the river. Also at some places a brook
      flowed through the brushwood which they crossed without difficulty. The
      opposite bank seemed to be more varied and the valley, of which the river
      occupied the center, was more sharply patterned. The hill, covered by
      trees of various sizes, formed a curtain which obstructed vision. On the
      right bank walking would have been difficult because of the cavities in
      the ground and because of the trees which, curved to the surface of the
      water, were held in place only by their roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say this forest as well as the bank already travelled over,
      showed no sign of any human touch. Pencroff noted the recent footprints
      of quadrupedes of a species he did not recognize. Most certainly—and this
      was also Herbert’s opinion—they had been left by formidable wild beasts
      which they would have to contend with doubtless; but nowhere the mark of
      a hatchet on a tree trunk nor the remains of an extinguished fire nor a
      footprint. They should perhaps congratulate themselves because in this
      part of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be feared
      than desired.

      <b>Pencorff noted the recent footprints.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      Herbert and Pencroff scarcely spoke because of the great difficulties
      along the path. They advanced very slowly and after an hour they had
      scarcely gone a mile. Until then the hunt had not been productive.
      However, several birds were chirping and flying about under the branches
      showing themselves to be very timid as if man instinctively inspired them
      with a justifiable fear. Among other winged creatures Herbert noted, in a
      marshy part of the forest, a bird with a sharp and elongated beak which
      anatomically resembled a kingfisher. However it was distinguished by its
      rather rugged plummage which was coated with a metallic brilliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This must be a ‘Jacamar’,” said Herbert, trying to close in on the
      animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It will be quite an occasion to taste jacamar,” replied the sailor, “if
      this bird is in a humor to let himself be roasted.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a stone, skillfully and vigorously thrown by the lad,
      struck the creature as it was about to fly off but this was not enough
      because the jacamar flew away at full speed and disappeared in an
      instant. “How clumsy I am,” cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not at all, my boy,” replied the sailor. “It was a good throw and more
      than one person would have missed the bird completely. Come! Do not feel
      frustrated. We will catch it another day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration continued. As the hunters made headway the trees became
      more spacious and magnificent but none produced any edible fruit.
      Pencroff looked in vain for a few of those precious palm trees which have
      so many uses in domestic life and which are found as far as the fortieth
      parallel in the northern hemisphere and down to only the thirty fifth
      parallel in the southern hemisphere. But this forest was composed only of
      conifers such as the deodars, already recognized by Herbert, of Douglas
      pines, resembling those growing on the northwest coast of America, and of
      admirable spruce measuring a hundred fifty feet in height.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a flock of small birds with a pretty plumage, with a long
      and sparkling tail, scattered themselves among the branches, spreading
      their weakly attached feathers which covered the ground with a fine down.
      Herbert picked up a few of these feathers and after having examined them:
    </p>
    <p>
      “These are ‘couroucous’,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would prefer a guinea fowl or a grouse cock,” replied Pencroff, “but
      are they good to eat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are good to eat and their flesh is even tender,” replied Herbert.
      “Besides, if I am not mistaken, it is easy to approach them and kill them
      with a stick.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and the lad glided among the grass arriving at the foot of a
      tree whose lower branches were covered with small birds. The couroucous
      were waiting for the passage of insects, which served as their
      nourishment. One could see their feathered feet strongly clenching the
      sprouts which served to support them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters then straightened themselves up and moving their sticks like
      a scythe, they grazed entire rows of these couroucous who did not think
      of flying away and stupidly allowed themselves to be beaten. A hundred
      littered the ground when the others decided to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said Pencroff, “here is game made for hunters such as ourselves.
      We have only to reach out for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      On a flexible stick the sailor strung up the couroucous like larks and
      the exploration continued. They noted that the watercourse took a gentle
      turn southward but this detour could not really be a prolonged one
      because the river’s source was in the mountain and was fed by the melting
      snow which covered the sides of the central cone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The particular object of this excursion, as we know, was to procure for
      the hosts of the Chimneys the largest possible quantity of game. One
      could not say that this goal had been attained up to now. The sailor
      actively pursued his search and how he raved when some animal that he did
      not even have time to recognize, escaped among the tall grass. If only
      they had had the dog Top. But Top had disappeared at the same time as his
      master and had probably perished with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o’clock in the afternoon they caught a glimpse of new flocks
      of birds who were pecking at the aromatic berries of certain trees,
      junipers among others. Suddenly, the real sound of a trumpet was heard in
      the forest. It was the strange and loud fanfare made by gallinules which
      are called “grouse” in the United States. Soon they saw several couples,
      with a variety of brown and fawn colored plumage, and with a brown tail.
      Herbert recognized the males by the two pointed fins formed by feathers
      raised on their neck. Pencroff judged it indispensable to get hold of one
      of these gallinules, as big as a hen, and whose flesh is like that of a
      prairie chicken. But this was difficult because they would not allow
      themselves to be approached. After several fruitless attempts, which had
      no other result than to frighten the grouse, the sailor said to the lad:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Decidedly, since we can’t kill them in flight, we will try to take them
      with a line.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Like a fish?” cried Herbert, very surprised at this suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Like a fish,” the sailor replied seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff found among the grass a half dozen of the grouse’s nests, each
      having two or three eggs. He took great care not to touch these nests to
      which their proprietors would not fail to return. It was around these
      nests that he intended to stretch his lines—not collar traps but real
      hook lines. He took Herbert some distance away from the nests and there
      he prepared his strange contraption with the care appropriate to a
      disciple of Isaac Walton.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> Herbert followed
      this activity with an interest easy to understand, while doubting its
      success. The lines were made of thin creepers fastened to one another to
      a length of fifteen to twenty feet. Some large strong thorns with bent
      points, furnished by a dwarf acacia bush, were tied to the ends of the
      creepers to take the place of hooks. As an allurement some large red
      worms, which were crawling on the ground, were put on the thorns.
    </p>
    <p>
      That done, Pencroff moved among the grass skillfully concealing himself,
      placing the end of his lines with baited hooks near the grouse’s nests.
      Then he returned taking the other end and concealing himself with Herbert
      behind a large tree. Both then waited patiently. Herbert, it should be
      said, did not count much on the success of the inventive Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long half hour passed but, as predicted by the sailor, several couples
      of grouse returned to their nests. They hopped, pecked the ground, and
      gave no sign that they suspected the presence of the hunters who had
      taken care to place themselves to the leeward of the gallinules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly at this moment the lad was very attentive. He held his breath
      and Pencroff staring, his mouth open, his lips protruding as if he was
      about to taste a piece of grouse, was hardly breathing. However the
      gallinules walked among the hooks without noticing them. Pencroff then
      made small jerks which moved the bait as if the worms were still alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly at this moment the sailor felt an emotion greater than that of
      the fisherman. The latter does not see his prey approaching in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jerks soon attracted the attention of the gallinules and they pecked
      at the hooks. Three grouse, doubtless very voracious, swallowed both the
      bait and the hook. Suddenly with a quick movement, Pencroff sprung his
      trap and the flapping of the wings indicated to him that the birds had
      been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah!” he shouted, dashing toward the game which he made himself
      master of in an instant.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/071.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>“Hurrah!” he shouted.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time he had seen birds taken
      with a line but the sailor very modestly told him that it was not his
      first try and not his invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And in any case,” he added, “in the situation that we find ourselves, we
      must depend on measures such as these.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The grouse were tied by their feet and Pencroff, happy that he was not
      returning with empty hands, and seeing that the day was coming to an end,
      decided to return to his dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path to follow was indicated by the river, there being no question of
      which direction, and at about six o’clock, rather tired from their
      excursion, Herbert and Pencroff again entered the Chimneys.
