      <b class="cap">The</b> next day—the 20th of October—at seven o’clock in
      the morning, after a voyage of four days, the <i>Bonadventure</i> gently
      went aground on the beach at the mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Neb, very uneasy about the bad weather and the prolonged
      absence of their companions, had climbed to Grand View Plateau at
      daybreak and they finally saw the boat which had been so long in
      returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “God be praised! There they are!” shouted Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, in his joy, began to dance, turning around, clapping his hands and
      shouting: “Oh! My master,” a pantomime more touching than the finest
      discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer’s first thought, on counting the people that he could see on
      the bridge of the <i>Bonadventure</i>, was that Pencroff had not found
      the castaway of Tabor Island or that at least the unfortunate had refused
      to leave his island to exchange his prison for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, Pencroff, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were alone on the bridge
      of the <i>Bonadventure</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when the boat came alongside, the engineer and Neb were
      waiting on the shore and before the passengers could jump to the sand,
      Cyrus Smith said to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends. Have you met with
      any difficulty?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Gideon Spilett, “on the contrary, everything went well. We
      will tell you about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However,” replied the engineer, “you have failed in your search, since
      there are only three of you, the same as when you left.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse me, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor, “we are four!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You found this castaway?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you brought him back?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Living?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is he? What is he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is,” replied the reporter, “or rather he was a man. That Cyrus, is
      all that we can tell you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was soon brought up to date on what had occurred on the
      trip. They related under what conditions the search had been conducted,
      how the only dwelling on the islet had long been abandoned, how finally
      the capture was made of a castaway who no longer seemed to belong to the
      human species.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the point is,” added Pencroff, “that I don’t know if we were right
      in bringing him here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly you were right, Pencroff,” replied the engineer vividly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But this unfortunate no longer has his reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is possible for now,” replied Cyrus Smith, “but hardly several
      months ago this unfortunate was a man like you or me. And who knows what
      will become of the last survivor among us after a long solitude on this
      island? It is a misfortune to be alone, my friends, and it seems that
      loneliness has quickly destroyed his sanity since you found this poor
      soul in such a condition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, Mister Cyrus,” asked Herbert, “what leads you to believe that the
      brutishness of this unfortunate occurred only a few months ago?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because the document that we found has been recently written,” replied
      the engineer, “and only the castaway could have written this document.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Assuming,” said Gideon Spilett, “that it was not composed by a companion
      of this man, since dead.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is impossible, my dear Spilett.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because the document would have mentioned two castaways,” replied Cyrus
      Smith, “but it only spoke of one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words, Herbert related the incidents that occurred during the
      return crossing and emphasized the strange fact about the fleeting return
      of the prisoner’s senses when, for a moment, he became a sailor again at
      the height of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Herbert,” replied the engineer, “you are right to attach a great
      importance to this fact. This unfortunate is not incurable and it is
      despair that has made him what he is. But here he has his fellow beings
      and since he still has a soul within him, this soul we will save.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and to
      the great astonishment of Neb, was then escorted from the forward cabin
      that he occupied on the <i>Bonadventure</i>, and once on land his first
      impulse was to flee.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cyrus Smith approached, put his hand on his shoulder with a gesture
      full of authority, and looked at him with infinite gentleness. Soon the
      unfortunate submitted to his authority, he became calmer little by
      little, his eyes lowered, his face inclined and he made no more
      resistance.
    </p>

      <b>Cyrus Smith put his hand on his shoulder.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      “This poor forsaken man!” murmured the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith looked at him carefully. Judging from his appearance, the
      castaway no longer had anything human about him but Cyrus Smith detected
      an elusive glimmer of intelligence, as had the reporter previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger—because this is
      what his new companions would henceforth call him—would remain in one of
      the rooms of Granite House from which, besides, he could not escape. They
      escorted him there without difficulty and with good care they could hope
      that one day he would become an additional companion to the colonists of
      Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter, Herbert and Pencroff were dying of hunger. During a
      breakfast that Neb quickly put together, they told Cyrus Smith all the
      incidents in detail that marked the exploration of the islet. He agreed
      with his friends on this point that the stranger had to be either English
      or American because the name Britannia suggested this, and besides, under
      his unkempt beard, under this hairy growth, the engineer thought that he
      saw the characteristic features of the Anglo-Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But, as a matter of fact,” said Gideon Spilett to Herbert, “you did not
      tell us how you met this savage and all we know is that he would have
      strangled you if we did not chance to arrive in time to save you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear me,” replied Herbert, “I’m not sure what happened. I was, I
      believe, occupied with collecting some plants when I heard a noise like
      an avalanche falling from a tree. I hardly had time to turn around... The
      unfortunate was doubtless hiding in a tree and fell upon me in less time
      than I can tell you about it and without Mister Spilett and Pencroff...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My child!” said Cyrus Smith, “you ran a real danger, but without it
      perhaps this poor person would always have remained hidden and we would
      not have had an additional companion.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You hope then, Cyrus, to rehabilitate him?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal ended, Cyrus Smith and his companions left Granite House and
      returned to the beach. They then unloaded the <i>Bonadventure</i>. The
      engineer examined the arms and the tools but he saw nothing that would
      enable him to establish the identity of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capture of the pigs was considered a very profitable thing for
      Lincoln Island and these animals were conducted to the stables where they
      easily became acclimatized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two barrels containing powder and shot, as well as the primer caps,
      were very well received. They agreed to establish a small arsenal either
      outside Granite House or even in the upper cavern where there was no fear
      of the effects of an explosion. Nevertheless the use of pyroxle would be
      continued because this substance gave excellent results and there was no
      reason to substitute ordinary powder for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the unloading of the boat was completed:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Cyrus,” said Pencroff, “I think that it would be prudent to put
      our <i>Bonadventure</i> in a secure place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Isn’t the mouth of the Mercy suitable?” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor. “Half the time it is stranded on
      the sand which strains it. It is a good boat, as you can see, and it
      behaved well during the windstorm that struck us so violently on our
      return,”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can’t we leave it afloat on the river?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless, Mister Cyrus, we could do that, but this mouth presents no
      shelter, and with the winds from the east, I believe that the
      <i>Bonadventure</i> would suffer much from the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, where would you like to put it, Pencroff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “At Port Balloon,” replied the sailor. “This small creek, protected by
      the rocks, seems to me to be just the port we need.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Isn’t it a little far?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah! It’s not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have a
      fine straight road to take us there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do it, Pencroff. Bring your <i>Bonadventure</i> there,” replied the
      engineer. “And yet I would much prefer to have it under our more
      immediate surveillance. When we have the time, we must make a small port
      for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wonderful,” shouted Pencroff. “A port with a lighthouse, a breakwater
      and a repair dock. Ah, really, with you Mister Cyrus, everything becomes
      easy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my worthy Pencroff,” replied the engineer, “but on the condition,
      however, that you help me because you are good for three quarters of all
      our work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and the sailor then went back on board the <i>Bonadventure</i>,
      the anchor was raised, the sail hoisted, and the wind rapidly brought it
      to Cape Claw. Two hours later it was resting on the tranquil waters of
      Port Balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first days that the stranger passed at Granite House, did he
      give them reason to think that his savage nature was changing? Did some
      intense spark shine deep within his obscure mind? Would the soul return
      to the body? Yes, assuredly, and on this very point, Cyrus Smith and the
      reporter asked themselves whether the sanity of the unfortunate had ever
      been totally extinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since he was accustomed to the wide open spaces and unlimited liberty
      which he enjoyed on Tabor Island, the stranger at first manifested some
      muted fury and they feared that he would throw himself on the beach from
      one of the windows of Granite House. But little by little he became calm
      and they were able to allow him the liberty of his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then had good reason for hope. Already forgetting his instincts as a
      raw flesh eater, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment than
      that which he ate on the islet. Cooked meat did not produce the revulsion
      in him that he had manifested on board the <i>Bonadventure</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith profited from a moment when he was asleep to cut his hair and
      unkempt beard which had formed a sort of mane and gave him a savage
      appearance. He also dressed him in more suitable clothes after having
      removed the rag which covered him. Thanks to these cares, the result was
      that the stranger presented a human figure and it even seemed that his
      eyes became more gentle. Certainly, when his former intelligence would
      return, the figure of this man would have a sort of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day Cyrus Smith imposed upon himself the task of spending a few
      hours in his company. He worked near him and occupied himself with
      various things so as to capture his attention. In fact, a spark would
      suffice to illuminate his soul, some remembrance crossing his mind would
      bring back his sanity. They had seen this on board the
      <i>Bonadventure</i> during the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer did not neglect to speak loudly so as to penetrate at the
      same time the organs of hearing and sight to the depths of his dulled
      intelligence. Sometimes one of his companions, sometimes another,
      sometimes all would join him. Very often they spoke of those things that
      would interest a sailor and which would appeal to him. At times the
      stranger paid some attention to what was said and the colonists soon
      concluded that he partly understood them. Sometimes his expression was
      deeply painful, proving that he suffered inwardly, because his face could
      not be mistaken about this, but he did not speak in spite of some moments
      when they thought he had some words at the tip of his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be it as it may, the poor soul was calm and sad. But was his calm only
      apparent? Wasn’t his sadness only the consequence of his being confined?
      They could not tell. Seeing only certain objects in a limited field and
      having no contact except with the colonists to whom he became accustomed,
      having no desire to satisfy, having better food and better clothing, it
      was natural that his physical nature should change a bit; but did this
      signify a new life for him or rather, to use a word which would correctly
      apply to him, was he merely becoming tame like an animal with a master?
      This was an important question that Cyrus Smith wanted to resolve quickly
      yet he did not wish to hurt his patient. For him the stranger was a
      patient. Would he ever become a convalescent?
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer observed him constantly. How he was on the alert for his
      soul to show itself, if one may speak this way! How he was ready to seize
      it!
    </p>
    <p>
      With sincere emotion the colonists followed all the phases of this cure
      undertaken by Cyrus Smith. They also helped him with this work of
      humanity and all, except perhaps for the incredulous Pencroff, soon began
      to share his hope and his faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger’s calm was deep, as has been said, and he showed a sort of
      attachment to the engineer, to whose influence he visibly submitted.
      Cyrus Smith decided to test this by bringing him to other surroundings,
      before this ocean which he formerly gazed at and to the edge of the
      forest which would remind him of those forests where he spent many years
      of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” said Gideon Spilett, “can we hope that once set at liberty he will
      not escape?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s an experiment we must make,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good!” said Pencroff. “When this here chap finds the open spaces in
      front of him and he inhales the fresh air, he will be off as fast as his
      legs can carry him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t believe that,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us try,” said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us try,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day was the 30th of October and consequently it was now nine days
      that the castaway from Tabor Island had been a prisoner at Granite House.
      It was warm and a fine sun cast its rays on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Pencroff went to the room occupied by the stranger and
      found him leaning at the window looking at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, my friend,” the engineer said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger immediately got up. With his eyes fixed on Cyrus Smith, he
      followed him. The sailor was to the rear of him, having little confidence
      in the result of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the door, Cyrus Smith and Pencroff made him take his place in
      the elevator while Neb, Herbert and Gideon Spilett waited for them below
      at the foot of Granite House. The basket descended and in a few moments
      all were together on the shore. The colonists moved away a little from
      the stranger so as to give him some liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter took a few steps advancing toward the sea. His gaze shone with
      extreme animation but he did not seek to escape. He looked at the small
      waves which, broken by the islet, came to die on the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is still only the sea,” noted Gideon Spilett, “and it is possible
      that it does not inspire him with the desire to escape.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Cyrus Smith, “we must take him to the plateau, to the edge
      of the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides, he cannot escape,” noted Neb, “since the bridges are raised.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” said Pencroff, “a man like this will not be inconvenienced by a
      creek such as Glycerin Creek. He will cross it in a single bound.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will see,” Cyrus Smith was content to reply, not taking his eyes away
      from those of his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was taken to the mouth of the Mercy, and they all then
      ascended the left bank of the river, reaching Grand View Plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving in the vicinity of the first fine trees of the forest, with the
      breeze gently blowing through their foliage, the stranger inhaled with
      rapture the scent that permeated the air and a deep sigh escaped from his
      chest.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/520.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>A deep sigh escaped from his chest.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      The colonists kept to the rear ready to seize him if he should try to
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact, he was on the point of throwing himself into the creek that
      separated him from the forest and for a moment his legs bent like a
      spring... But almost immediately he fell back, he collapsed and large
      tears flowed from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” said Cyrus Smith, “you have become a man again, since you are
      crying.”
