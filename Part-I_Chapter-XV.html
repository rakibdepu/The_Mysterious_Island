      <b class="cap">The</b> next day, April 17th, the sailor’s first words
      were directed to Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well sir,” he asked him, “what shall we do today?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whatever pleases Cyrus,” replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until then they had been brickmakers and potters. Now the engineer’s
      companions would become metallurgists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous day, after lunch, the exploration had been carried to the
      point of Cape Mandible, nearly seven miles distant from the Chimneys.
      There the long series of dunes was ended and the soil took on a volcanic
      appearance. There were no longer any high walls such as Grand View
      Plateau but an outlandish and capricious border which surrounded the
      narrow gulf between the two capes, formed by mineral material vomited
      from the volcano. Arriving at this point the colonists retraced their
      steps and as night was falling they again entered the Chimneys. They did
      not go to sleep before definitely resolving the question of whether they
      should quit Lincoln Island or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Tuamotu
      archipelago was a considerable distance. A boat would not be sufficient
      to cross it especially with the bad season coming on. Pencroff had
      expressly said so. Now to construct a simple boat, even having the
      necessary tools, was a difficult task and, the colonists not having any
      tools, they would have to begin by making hammers, axes, adzes, saws,
      augers, planes, etc. which would take time. It was therefore decided that
      they would winter on Lincoln Island and that they would find a dwelling
      more comfortable than the Chimneys to pass the winter months.
    </p>
    <p>
      First they would proceed to utilize the iron ore, of which the engineer
      had noted several beds in the northwest part of the island, and to change
      this mineral into iron or into steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soil does not generally contain metals in the pure state. For the most
      part they are found combined with oxygen or with sulphur. In particular,
      of the two specimens brought back by Cyrus Smith, one was magnetic iron,
      not carbonated, the other pyrites, otherwise known as ferric sulphide. It
      was thus the first, the iron oxide, that he would have to reduce with
      carbon, that is to say to remove the oxygen in order to obtain a pure
      state. This reduction is done by subjecting the mineral to a high
      temperature in the presence of carbon, either by the rapid and easy
      “Catalan Method” which has the advantage of directly transforming the
      mineral into iron in a single operation, or by the blast furnace method,
      which first changes the mineral into cast iron, then the cast iron into
      iron by raising the amount of carbon combined with it to three or four
      percent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what was it that Cyrus Smith needed? It was iron and not cast iron
      and he had to look for the most rapid method of reduction. Besides, the
      mineral that he had collected was by itself very pure and very rich. It
      was the ferrous oxide which is encountered in jumbled aggregates of a
      deep grey, giving a black dust crystallized in regular octahedrons. It
      makes natural lodestones and is used in Europe to make ferrous products
      of the highest quality. Sweden and Norway are abundantly provided with
      it. Not far from this bed were found the coal seams already exploited by
      the colonists. There the treatment of the mineral would be facilitated
      since the fabrication elements would be near each other. This is the same
      situation that makes for the lavish wealth of the United Kingdom where
      the coal and the metal are extracted from the same soil and at the same
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, Mister Cyrus,” Pencroff said to him, “we will work the iron ore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and for that—this will not
      displease you—we will begin with a seal hunt on the islet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A seal hunt!” cried the sailor, turning toward Gideon Spilett, “Is a
      seal needed to make iron?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Since Cyrus has said so,” replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the engineer had already left the Chimneys and Pencroff prepared for
      the seal hunt without having obtained any other explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Cyrus Smith, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb and the sailor had
      gathered on the shore at the point where the channel permitted a sort of
      fordable passage at low tide. The sea was then at low tide and the
      hunters could cross the channel without wetting themselves above the
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith then set foot on the islet for the first time and his
      companions for the second time since it was there that the balloon had
      thrown them at the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their arrival, a few hundred auks looked at them guilelessly. The
      colonists, armed with clubs, could have easily killed them but they would
      not dream of committing such a doubly useless massacre, because it was
      important not to frighten the amphibians who were lying on the sand
      several cable lengths away. They also respected certain innocent penguins
      whose wings, reduced to the state of stumps, were flattened in the form
      of fins and trimmed with feathers of a scaly appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists therefore advanced prudently toward the north point,
      walking on soil riddled with small holes which formed the nests of
      aquatic birds. Near the extremity of the islet appeared large black
      specks floating on the level of the water. One could say they were the
      tops of rocks in motion.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

        "" /><br />
        <b>The colonists advanced prudently.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      They were the amphibians to be captured. It was necessary to let them
      land because with their narrow pelvis, their close-cropped hair, and
      their slender shape, these seals, who were excellent swimmers, would be
      difficult to capture in the sea whereas on land their short webbed feet
      allowed them only a not very rapid crawling movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff knew the habits of these amphibians and he advised waiting until
      they had stretched out on the sand under the rays of the sun which would
      not be long in putting them to sleep. They would then maneuver to cut off
      their retreat and to knock them on the nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters thus concealed themselves behind the rocks on the shore and
      they waited silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed before the seals came to frolic on the sand. They could
      count half a dozen. Pencroff and Herbert then broke off in order to turn
      the point of the islet, to take them from the rear and to cut off their
      retreat. During this time Cyrus Smith, Gideon Spilett and Neb, crawling
      along the rocks, glided toward the future theater of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the tall stature of the sailor emerged. Pencroff uttered a cry.
      The engineer and his two companions quickly threw themselves between the
      sea and the seals. Two of these animals, vigorously struck, remained dead
      on the sand, but the others were able to regain and take to the open sea.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/193.jpg" border="1" width="330" height="467" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b>These animals, vigorously struck...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “Here are the seals asked for, Mister Cyrus,” said the sailor, advancing
      toward the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good,” replied Cyrus Smith. “We will make forge bellows of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forge bellows!” cried Pencroff. “Well, these are lucky seals.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in fact a blowing machine, necessary for the treatment of the
      mineral, that the engineer counted on making with the skin of these
      amphibians. They were of an average size because their length was not
      more than six feet. Their heads resembled that of dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since it was pointless to burden themselves with the rather considerable
      weight of these two animals, Neb and Pencroff resolved to skin them on
      the spot while Cyrus Smith and the reporter ended by exploring the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor and the negro did their work skillfully and three hours later
      Cyrus Smith had at his disposal two seal skins which he counted on using
      in this state without subjecting them to any tanning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists had to wait for low tide. Crossing the channel, they
      returned to the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no small job to soften these skins on the wooden frames designed
      to spread them out, and to sew them up by means of fibers so as to be
      able to store air there without letting too much escape. It was necessary
      to rework it several times. Cyrus Smith only had the two steel blades
      from Top’s collar at his disposal. Nevertheless, he was so skillful and
      his companions helped him with such intelligence that three days later
      the tool inventory of the small colony was increased by a blowing machine
      designed to inject air into a mineral subjected to heat—a condition
      indispensable for the success of the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the morning of the 20th of April that “the metallurgical period”
      began, so-called by the reporter in his notes. The engineer had decided,
      as we know, to work both the coal and mineral beds. Now, from his
      observations, these beds were situated at the foot of the northeast
      buttresses of Mount Franklin, that is to say at a distance of six miles.
      They could not therefore think of returning each day to the Chimneys. It
      was agreed that the small colony would camp under a hut of branches so
      that the important operation could be followed night and day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This decided, they left in the morning. Neb and Pencroff dragged the
      bellows on a hurdle together with a certain quantity of vegetables and
      animal provisions which, besides, they would renew on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path followed was through Jacamar Woods which they crossed obliquely
      from the southeast to the northwest and in its thickest part. It was
      necessary to blaze a trail which would later form the most direct artery
      between Grand View Plateau and Mount Franklin. The trees, belonging to
      species already recognized, were magnificent. Herbert again noted, among
      others, some dragon trees which Pencroff called “pretentious
      warts”—because in spite of their size they were of the same family of
      liliaceous plants as the onion, the chive, the shallot or asparagus.
      These dragon trees could provide ligneous roots which are excellent when
      cooked and which give a very agreeable liqueur when subjected to a
      certain fermentation. They gathered some of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path across the woods was long. It lasted the entire day but this
      permitted them to observe the fauna and the flora. Top, more especially
      in charge of the fauna, followed a path through the grass and brushwood,
      indiscriminately flushing out every kind of game. Herbert and Gideon
      Spilett killed two kangaroos with arrows and also an animal that bore a
      strong resemblance to a hedgehog and to an anteater; to the first because
      it rolled itself into a ball and bristled with quills; to the second
      because it had burrowing claws and a long slim snout with a bird’s beak
      at the end and an extendable tongue furnished with small quills which
      served to retain insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when it will be in a boiling pot,” Pencroff artlessly asked, “what
      will it resemble?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An excellent piece of beef,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will not ask more of it,” replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this excursion they saw some wild boars who did not seek to attack
      the small troop. It did not appear wise to collide with these formidable
      beasts when, in a thick hedge, the reporter thought he saw, several feet
      away among the main branches of a tree, an animal which he took for a
      bear. He quietly took to sketching it. Very happily for Gideon Spilett
      the animal in question did not appear to be of this formidable family of
      plantigrades. This was only a koala, better known under the name of
      sloth, which was the size of a large dog with dull bristling hair. Its
      paws are armed with strong claws, permitting it to climb trees and eat
      the leaves. Verification of the identity of the said animal having been
      made, there was no need to disturb it. Gideon Spilett erased “bear” from
      the title of his sketch, put “koala” in its place and the journey was
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o’clock in the evening Cyrus Smith gave the signal to halt. They
      found themselves outside the forest at the base of those powerful
      buttresses which supported Mount Franklin on its eastern side. Red Creek
      flowed several hundred feet away and consequently potable water was not
      far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp was immediately organized. In less than an hour at the edge of the
      forest among the trees, a hut of branches intermingled with creepers and
      cemented with clay offered a sufficient retreat. They postponed the
      geological searches for the next day. Supper was prepared, a good fire
      burned in front of the hut, the spit turned, and at eight o’clock, while
      one of the colonists watched to keep up the fire in the event some
      dangerous beast might prowl about, the others slept well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Smith, accompanied by Herbert,
      went to look for those terrains of ancient formation where he had already
      found a mineral specimen. He again discovered the bed at ground level,
      near the sources of the creek at the foot of the lateral base of one of
      the buttresses on the northeast side. The very rich iron mineral,
      enclosed in a fusible gangue, was perfectly suitable for the reduction
      method that the engineer counted on using, that is to say the Catalan
      Method, but simplified as used in Corsica.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the Catalan Method, properly called, requires the construction of
      kilns and crucibles in which the mineral and the coal are placed in
      alternate layers to be transformed and reduced. But Cyrus Smith intended
      to economize on these constructions and wanted to simplify everything by
      forming a cubic mass of the mineral and coal into which he would direct
      the air from his bellows. This was the procedure doubtless employed by
      Tubal Cain and the first metallurgists of the inhabited world. Now, that
      which succeeded with the grandsons of Adam, that which still gave good
      results in the countries rich in mineral and in fuel, could not but
      succeed under the circumstances that the colonists of Lincoln Island
      found themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mineral was collected without difficulty at the same time as the coal
      and not far from the surface. First they broke the mineral into small
      pieces and they removed by hand the impurities which contaminated its
      surface. Then coal and mineral were placed in successive layers—as the
      charcoal burner does with wood that he wishes to carbonize. In this
      fashion, under the influence of the air forced in by the bellows, the
      coal would be transformed into carbonic acid, then into carbon monoxide
      which in turn reduces the iron oxide, that is to say it frees the oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer proceeded in this way. A tube of refractory clay, which had
      been previously made in the kiln, was used as an opening for the sealskin
      bellows. The latter was placed near the mineral heap. Actuated by a
      mechanism whose parts consisted of a chassis, fiber cords and
      counterweights, it injected air into the mass, elevating the temperature
      concurrent with the chemical transformation which would yield pure iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation was difficult. It required all the patience and ingenuity
      of the colonists to conduct it well, but finally it succeeded and the
      definite result was a blob of iron reduced to a spongy state which would
      have to be hammered and worked, that is to say forged to drive out the
      liquified gangue. It was evident that these improvised blacksmiths lacked
      the first hammer; but in the end they found themselves in the same
      situation as the first metallurgist and they did what he must have done.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/199.jpg" border="1" width="329" height="470" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b>The operation was difficult.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The first blob, attached to a club, served as a hammer to forge the
      second on an anvil of granite and they finally obtained a coarse but
      usable metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th of April, after much effort and fatigue, several bars of iron
      were forged and transformed into tools, pliers, tongs, picks, pickaxes,
      etc. which Pencroff and Neb declared to be true gems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This metal was not in the state of pure iron, especially that state of
      steel which would give the best service. Now steel is a combination of
      iron and carbon that is derived either from cast iron by removing the
      excess carbon, or from iron by adding to it the carbon that it lacks. The
      first, obtained by decarbonization of cast iron yields natural or puddled
      steel; the second, produced by the carbonization of iron, yields case
      hardened steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this last method that Cyrus Smith preferred since he possessed
      iron in a pure state. He succeeded in heating the metal with carbon
      powder in a crucible made of refractory clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      This steel, which is malleable hot and cold, was worked with a hammer.
      Neb and Pencroff, skillfully guided, made some axes which when heated red
      hot and suddenly plunged into cold water acquired an excellent temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other devices, crudely fashioned it goes without saying, were made in the
      same way, plane blades, axes, hatchets, sheets of steel which would be
      transformed into saws, carpenter’s shears, then pickaxes, shovels, picks,
      hammers, nails, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, on May 5th, the first metallurgical period was ended, the
      blacksmiths returned to the Chimneys and new work would soon authorize
      them to take on a new title.
