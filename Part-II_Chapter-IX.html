    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">The</b> weather changed during the first week of March.
      There had been a full moon at the beginning of the month and the heat was
      excessive. One felt that the atmosphere was charged with electricity and
      a more or less extended period of stormy weather was indeed to be feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact on the 2nd it thundered with extreme violence. The wind blew from
      the east and hail directly attacked the Granite House facade, crackling
      like a volley of grape-shot. They had to hermetically seal the door and
      the window shutters, otherwise all would have been flooded in the inside
      of the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon seeing these hailstones fall, some of which were the size of a
      pigeon’s egg, it occurred to Pencroff that his cornfield was in serious
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he ran to his field where the ears were already beginning to raise
      their little green heads and, with a large cloth he succeeded in
      protecting his harvest. He was pelted but he did not complain.
    </p>

        <b>Soon Pencroff ran to his cornfield.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This bad weather lasted for eight days during which the thunder did not
      cease. Between storms, they still heard it rumbling beyond the limits of
      the horizon; then it returned with new fury. The lightning hit several
      trees on the island, among others an enormous pine that grew near the
      lake at the edge of the forest. Two or three times the lightning struck
      the shore, melting the sand and vitrifying it. On recovering these
      fulgurites, the engineer was led to believe that it would be possible to
      make thick and sturdy window panes which would resist the wind, the rain
      and the hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, not having any pressing work to do outside, profited from
      the bad weather by working inside Granite House whose arrangements were
      perfected day by day. The engineer made a potter’s wheel which allowed
      him to turn out several articles for their clothing and for the kitchen,
      in particular some buttons which they needed badly. A rack was made to
      hold the weapons which were maintained with extreme care, and neither the
      shelves nor the closets left anything to desire. They sawed, they planed,
      they filed, they turned the potter’s wheel, and during the bad weather
      they heard only the grinding of the tools or the rumbling of the wheel
      responding to the roaring of the thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Jup had not been forgotten and he occupied his own room near the
      storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot filed with good litter which suited
      him perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With worthy Jup, never any recrimination,” Pencroff often repeated,
      “never any inconvenient response! What a servant, Neb, what a servant.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My pupil,” replied Neb, “and soon to be my equal!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your superior,” retorted the sailor laughing, “because you talk and he
      does not!”
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that Jup was now in the swing of things. He beat
      the clothes, he turned the spit, he swept the rooms, he served at the
      table, he arranged the wood and—a detail which enchanted Pencroff—he
      never went to sleep without coming to tuck in the worthy sailor in his
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimanes,
      quadrumanes or quadrupeds, it left nothing to desire. With this life in
      the open air, on this wholesome soil, under this temperate zone, working
      with body and mind, they could not believe that illness would ever affect
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well. In fact, Herbert had already grown two inches in a year.
      His figure was becoming more masculine and he promised to become a man
      accomplished in body and in morals. Besides, he profited by teaching
      himself during the spare time left to him after his manual occupations.
      He read some books found in the case and after the practical lessons
      which resulted from the very necessity of their situation, he found out
      about the sciences from the engineer and about languages from the
      reporter, masters who were pleased to complete his education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer’s obsession was to transmit all that he knew, to instruct by
      example as well as by word, and Herbert profited well from his
      professor’s lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If I die,” thought Cyrus Smith, “it is he who will take my place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm finally ended around the 9th of March but the sky remained
      covered with clouds during all of this last month of the summer. The
      atmosphere, violently troubled by these electrical disturbances, could
      not recover its former purity, and it was nearly always rain and fog
      except for three or four fine days which favored excursions of all sorts,
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time, the female onager gave birth to a young one which
      belonged to the same sex as her mother and which did well. At the corral
      there was also an increase in the flock and several lambs were already
      bleating under the hangars to the great joy of Neb and Herbert who each
      had their favorites among the new-born.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also tried to domesticate the peccaries, an attempt which completely
      succeeded. A stable was constructed near the poultry yard and they soon
      counted several young in a mood to be civilized, that is to say fattened
      under Neb’s care, Master Jup, charged with bringing them their daily
      nourishment, dishwater, kitchen scraps, etc. acquitted himself
      conscientiously in this job. He came now and then to amuse himself at the
      expense of his young boarders and to pull their tails, but it was
      mischievousness and not wickedness because these small wriggling tails
      amused him like a toy and his instinct was that of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day during this month of March, Pencroff, chatting with the engineer,
      reminded Cyrus Smith of a promise that he still had not had the time to
      fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You spoke of a sort of lift to replace the long ladders of Granite
      House, Mister Cyrus,” he said to him. “Won’t you make it some day?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You wish to speak of a sort of lift?” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Call it a lift if you wish,” replied the sailor, “the name means nothing
      provided it can lift us to our dwelling without fatigue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing will be easier, Pencroff, but is it useful?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, Mister Cyrus. Now that we have the necessities, let us think
      a little about comfort. For people it will be luxurious if you wish; but
      for things it is indispensable! It is not convenient to climb up a long
      ladder when one is heavily loaded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Pencroff, we will try to satisfy you,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you do not have any engine available.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will make it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A steam engine?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, a water engine.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact, to move his apparatus, a natural force was there for the
      engineer to use without great difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this purpose it sufficed to increase the flow of the small diversion
      from the lake which furnished water to the interior of Granite House. The
      opening arranged between the stones and grass at the upper end of the
      passageway was enlarged. This produced a strong fall at the bottom of the
      corridor, whose overflow fell into the inside well. Below the fall, the
      engineer installed a cylinder with paddles which connected to the outside
      with a strong cable wound around a wheel and supporting a basket. By
      means of a long cord which came to the ground, which could engage and
      disengage with the hydraulic motor, they could raise the basket to the
      door of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 17th of March when the lift functioned for the first time and
      gave universal satisfaction. Henceforth all the loads, the wood, coal,
      provisions and the colonists themselves were hoisted by this simple
      system which replaced the primitive ladder that no one missed. Top showed
      particular enchantment with this improvement because he did not have and
      could not have Master Jup’s skill in climbing ladders and often he made
      the climb to Granite House either on Neb’s back or on that of the orang
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Cyrus Smith also tried to make glass. First he had to
      adapt the old pottery furnace to this new application. This presented
      some rather great difficulties, but after several unfruitful attempts he
      succeeded in getting a glassworks going, which Gideon Spilett and
      Herbert, the natural assistants of the engineer, did not leave for
      several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the substances that enter into the composition of glass, they are
      only sand, chalk and soda (carbonate or sulphate). Now the shore could
      furnish the sand, the lime could furnish the chalk, the marine plants
      could furnish the soda, the pyrites could furnish the sulphuric acid, and
      the soil could furnish the coal to heat the furnace to the desired
      temperature. Thus Cyrus Smith found the conditions necessary for the
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tool whose manufacture would offer the most difficulty was the glass
      blower, an iron tube five or six feet long which would collect the
      material at one end and keep it in the fuzed state. But by means of a
      long and thin sheet of iron which was rolled up like a gun barrel,
      Pencroff succeeded in making this blower which was soon in working
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th of March the furnace was heated up. One hundred parts of
      sand, thirty five of chalk, forty of sodium sulphate, mixed with two or
      three parts of powdered coal, composed the substance which was placed in
      fire clay crucibles. When the high temperature of the furnace had reduced
      it to the liquid state or at least to a pasty state, Cyrus Smith
      collected a certain quantity of this paste with the blower; he worked and
      reworked it on a previously made plate of metal so as to give it a
      suitable shape for blowing; then he passed the blower to Herbert and told
      him to blow through the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Like making soap bubbles?” asked the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Herbert, puffing up his cheeks, blew into the blower taking care to
      turn it continually. His breath dilated the glassy mass. More fuzed
      material was added to the first batch and it soon resulted in a bubble
      that measured a foot in diameter. Then Cyrus Smith took the blower from
      Herbert’s hands and imparted a pendulum movement to it which ended by
      elongating the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindrical-conical
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blowing operation had thus given a glass cylinder terminated by two
      hemispherical domes which were easy to detach by means of a sharp iron
      dipped in cold water; then by the same procedure this cylinder was split
      along its length. Having been made malleable by a second heating, it was
      stretched out on a plate and flattened with a wooden roller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first glass pane was made and it was sufficient to repeat the
      operation fifty times to make fifty panes. The windows of Granite House
      were shortly provided with transparent panes, not very clear perhaps, but
      sufficiently transparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to cups, glasses and bottles, that was fun. Besides, they welcomed
      whatever came from the end of the blower. Pencroff asked for the
      privilege of “blowing” when his turn came, and it was a pleasure for him,
      but he blew so hard that his products took on the most amusing shapes,
      which earned his admiration.
    </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      During one of the excursions that was made about this time, a new tree
      was discovered whose produce added to the food supply of the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Herbert, while hunting, had ventured one day into the
      forest of the Far West on the left bank of the Mercy and, as always, the
      lad asked a thousand questions of the engineer to which he gladly
      replied. But they did not have their minds on the hunting which was the
      reason that they had no success. Now since Cyrus Smith was not a hunter
      and since Herbert, on the other hand, spoke about chemistry and physics,
      many a kangaroo, capybara and agouti within easy reach escaped the lad’s
      shots. The result was that, with the day nearly over, the two hunters
      would probably have a useless excursion, when Herbert stopped and uttered
      a joyous cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! Mister Cyrus, do you see this tree?”
    </p>
    <p>
      And he showed him a shrub rather than a tree because it was only composed
      of a single stem, covered with a scaly bark, which carried striped leaves
      with small parallel veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what is this tree which resembles a small palm tree?” asked Cyrus
      Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a sago palm whose picture I have in our natural history
      dictionary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I do not see any fruit on this bush.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Mister Cyrus,” replied Herbert, “but its trunk has a flour that
      nature has already ground for us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the breadfruit tree?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! The breadfruit tree.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my boy,” replied the engineer, “this is a precious discovery while
      we are waiting for our wheat harvest. Let’s get to work and I hope that
      you are not mistaken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not mistaken. He broke a stem of a sago which was composed of
      a glandular texture enclosing a certain quantity of floury pith,
      traversed by ligneous bundles, separated by rings of the same substance
      arranged concentrically. With this flour was mixed a gummy sap with a
      disagreeable taste but that would be easy to remove by pressure. This
      cellular substance formed an extremely nourishing flour of superior
      quality whose exportation was formerly prohibited by Japanese laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Herbert, after having studied the portion of the Far West
      where the sago grew, took some reference points and returned to Granite
      House where they made their discovery known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the colonists came to the harvest and Pencroff, becoming
      more and more enthusiastic about his island, said to the engineer:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Cyrus, do you believe that there are islands for castaways?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean by that, Pencroff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I mean that there are islands created especially to make a
      shipwreck convenient, and on which poor devils can always manage their
      affairs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is possible,” replied the engineer, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is certain, sir,” replied Pencroff, “and it is none the less certain
      that Lincoln Island in one of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to Granite House with an ample harvest of sago stems. The
      engineer made a press in order to extract the gummy sap mixed with the
      flour and he obtained a significant quantity of flour which, in Neb’s
      hands, were transformed into cakes and puddings. It still was not real
      wheat bread but one could imagine that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period the onager, the goats and the sheep of the corral
      furnished the daily milk necessary for the colony. Also the cart, or
      rather a sort of light covered trap which replaced it, made frequent
      trips to the corral, and when it was Pencroff’s turn to do it, he took
      Jup and had him drive it. Jup cracked his whip and acquitted himself with
      his usual intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All therefore prospered, at Granite House as well as at the corral and
      truly the colonists, though they were far from their native land, had
      nothing to complain of. They were so well made for this life and besides
      so accustomed to this island, that they would not have left its
      hospitable soil without regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, such is the love of one’s country in the heart of man, that if
      some vessel had unexpectedly appeared in view of the island, the
      colonists would have signaled it, they would have attracted its
      attention, and they would have left!... While waiting for this, they
      lived a happy existence, and they feared rather than desired any event
      which might come to interrupt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who could deceive himself and take comfort in illusions that fortune
      would always favor them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Be it as it may, this Lincoln Island on which the colonists had lived for
      more than a year was often the subject of their conversation, and one day
      an observation was made which would later have serious consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 1st of April, Easter Sunday, that Cyrus Smith and his
      companions had sanctified with rest and prayer. It was a fine day like an
      October day in the northern hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, toward evening, all were gathered under the veranda at the
      edge of Grand View Plateau and they looked at night coming on at the
      horizon. Several cups of this beverage of elder tree berries, which took
      the place of coffee, had been served by Neb. They chatted about the
      island and its isolated position in the Pacific when Gideon Spilett was
      led to say:
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>They chatted about the island and its isolated position.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “My dear Cyrus, have you, since you possessed this sextant in the case,
      have you again taken the bearings of our island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But wouldn’t it perhaps be wise to do it, with this instrument which is
      more accurate than the one you used?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s the good?” said Pencroff. “The island is doing right well where
      it is!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but the imperfection of the
      apparatus has affected the accuracy of the observations which can easily
      be verified exactly...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, my dear Spilett,” replied the engineer, “and I should
      have made this verification sooner, but if I have committed some error it
      should not be more than 5° in longitude or in latitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, who knows?” replied the reporter, “who knows if we are not much
      nearer to inhabited land than we think?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will know tomorrow,” replied Cyrus Smith, “and we would have known it
      already if it were not for those occupations which left me no leisure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine!” said Pencroff, “Mister Cyrus is too good an observer to be
      mistaken and if the island has not budged from its place, then it is just
      where he put it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, by means of the sextant, the engineer made the observations
      necessary to verify the coordinates that he had already obtained and this
      was the result of his operation:
    </p>
    <p>
      His first observation had given him for the position of Lincoln Island:
    </p>
    <p>
      In west longitude: from 150° to 155°;
    </p>
    <p>
      In south latitude: from 30° to 35°. The second gave exactly:
    </p>
    <p>
      In west longitude: 150° 30′;
    </p>
    <p>
      In south latitude: 34° 57′.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in spite of the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus Smith had
      operated with such competence that his error had not exceeded five
      degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Gideon Spilett, “since we possess an atlas as well as a
      sextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position that Lincoln
      Island occupies in the Pacific.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert went to find the atlas which, as we know, had been edited in
      France and which consequently had its nomenclature in the French
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      They opened up the map of the Pacific and the engineer, compass in hand,
      prepared to determine its position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the compass stopped in his hand and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But an island already exists in this part of the Pacific!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An island,” cried Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ours, doubtless,” replied Gideon Spilett.

      “No,” replied Cyrus Smith. “This island is situated at 153° longitude and
      37° 11′ latitude, that is to say at two and a half degrees further west
      and two degrees further south than Lincoln Island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And what island is this?” asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tabor Island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “An important island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, an island lost in the Pacific, and which has probably never been
      visited.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, we will visit it,” said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Mister Cyrus. We will construct a decked boat and I will be in
      charge of sailing it. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A hundred and fifty miles! What’s that?” replied Pencroff. “In forty
      eight hours and with a good wind we will clear it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But for what good?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We don’t know. Let’s see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And on this response it was decided that a seaworthy boat would be
      constructed to take to the sea around the coming October at the return of
      the fine season.
