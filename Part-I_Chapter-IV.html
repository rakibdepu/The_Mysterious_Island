      <b class="cap">All</b> at once the reporter told the sailor to wait for
      him in this very place where he would rejoin him, and without losing an
      instant he ascended the coast in the direction followed by the negro Neb
      several hours earlier. Then he rapidly disappeared behind a corner of the
      coast, so anxious was he for news about the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert wanted to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stay here, my boy,” the sailor said to him. “We have to prepare an
      encampment and to see if it is possible to find something more
      substantial for the appetite than shellfish. Our friends will need to
      recuperate on their return. Each to his task.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am ready, Pencroff,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good!” replied the sailor. “That will do. Let us proceed methodically.
      We are tired, we are cold, we are hungry. Hence we must find shelter,
      fire and nourishment. The forest has wood, the nests have eggs; it
      remains to find a house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well,” replied Herbert, “I will look for a cave among these rocks
      and I will surely discover some hole in which we can hide.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s that,” replied Pencroff. “Let’s go, my boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And they both walked to the foot of the enormous wall on this beach that
      the receding tide had largely uncovered. But instead of going toward the
      north they went to the south. Several hundred feet from where they had
      landed, Pencroff noted that the coastline presented a narrow opening
      which, in his opinion, could be the mouth of a river or a brook. Now, on
      the one hand, it was important to establish themselves in the
      neighborhood of a potable watercourse, and on the other hand, it was not
      impossible that the current had thrown Cyrus Smith on this shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high wall, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet
      but the block was solid throughout, and even at its base, barely washed
      by the sea, it did not present the smallest fissure which could serve as
      a temporary dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall, made of a very hard
      granite which the waves had never eroded. Near the summit all kinds of
      sea birds fluttered about, in particular various web-footed species with
      long compressed pointed beaks—squalling, and hardly afraid of the
      presence of man who, for the first time no doubt, was thus disturbing
      their solitude. Among these web-footers Pencroff recognized several skua,
      a sort of sea gull which is sometimes called stercorarius and also the
      voracious little sea mews which nested in the crevices of the granite. A
      gunshot fired into this swarm of birds would have killed a great number;
      but to fire a gunshot, a gun was needed and neither Pencroff nor Herbert
      had one. Besides these sea mews and these skua are scarcely edible and
      even their eggs have a detestable taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Herbert, who had gone a little more to the left, soon noted
      several seaweed covered rocks which the high tide would cover again
      several hours later. On these rocks, amid slippery seaweed, bivalve
      shellfish abounded which hungry people could not disdain. Herbert called
      Pencroff, who quickly ran up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! These are mussels!” shouted the sailor. “Here is something to
      replace the eggs that we don’t have!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “These are not mussels!” replied young Herbert, who carefully examined
      the mollusks attached to the rocks, “they are lithodomes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And are they edible?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

        <b>“And are they edible?” asked Pencroff.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “Perfectly so.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then let us eat lithodomes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor could rely on Herbert. The young boy was very strong in
      natural history and always had a veritable passion for this science. His
      father had encouraged him in this line by letting him attend the courses
      of the best Boston professors who were fond of this intelligent and
      industrious lad. Moreover, his instincts as a naturalist would afterwards
      be utilized more than once and on this outset they did not deceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These lithodomes were oblong shells, tightly attached in clusters to the
      rocks. They belonged to that species of molluscous perforators which bore
      holes in the hardest stones. Their shell is rounded at both ends, a
      feature not to be found in the ordinary mussel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff and Herbert made a good meal of these lithodomes which were then
      half opened to the sun. They ate them like oysters, and found them to
      have a strong peppery taste which consoled them for not having either
      pepper nor any other sort of condiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hunger was thus appeased for the moment, but not their thirst,
      which increased after their consumption of these naturally spiced
      mollusks. They would have to find fresh water and it was not likely that
      it would be lacking in a region so randomly capricious. Pencroff and
      Herbert filled their pockets and handkerchiefs with an ample supply of
      lithodomes. They then went back to the foot of the high land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred feet further they arrived at this indentation in the
      coastline where, if Pencroff guessed correctly, a small river should be
      flowing. At this spot the wall appeared to have been separated by some
      violent subterranean action. At its base a cove was hollowed out, the far
      end forming a very sharp angle. The watercourse at that point measured
      one hundred feet in breadth, and its two banks on each side were barely
      twenty feet wide. The watercourse ran almost directly between the two
      walls of granite which were not as high upstream; then it turned abruptly
      and disappeared under some brushwood at a distance of half a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here is water! There is wood!” said Pencroff. “Well now, Herbert, all we
      need is the house!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The water of the river was clear. The sailor knew that at this moment of
      low tide the ocean had not reached here, and the water would be sweet.
      This important point established, Herbert looked for some cavity which
      would serve as a retreat but it was useless. Everywhere the wall was
      smooth, flat and perpendicular.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, at the very mouth of the river, above the line of high tide,
      there had formed, not a grotto, but a pile of enormous fallen rocks, such
      as are often met with in granite countries and which are called
      “Chimneys.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/039.jpg" border="1" width="333" height="461" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b>There had formed... a pile of enormous fallen rocks.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Pencroff and Herbert went rather far in among the rocks, in sandy
      passages where light was not wanting because it entered by openings among
      the granite rocks, some of which were supported only by a miracle of
      equilibrium. But with the light the wind also entered—really a corridor
      wind—and with the wind the sharp cold from the outside. However, the
      sailor thought that by obstructing certain portions of these passages, by
      closing some openings with a mixture of stones and sand, they could make
      the “Chimneys” habitable. The geometrical design of the “Chimneys”
      resembled the typographical sign <i>&amp;</i> which signifies <i>et
      cetera</i> abbreviated. Now, by isolating the upper loop of the sign,
      through which the wind blew from the south and from the west, they would
      doubtless succeed in putting the lower part to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here’s our work,” said Pencroff, “and if we ever see Mr. Smith again he
      will know what to make of this labyrinth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will see him again, Pencroff,” cried Herbert, “and when he returns he
      must find a halfway decent dwelling here. It will be so if we can build a
      fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We can do it, my boy,” replied the sailor, “and these chimneys”—that was
      the name that Pencroff kept for this temporary home—“will serve us. But
      first let us get a stock of fuel. I imagine that the wood will not be
      useless in stopping up these holes through which the very devil himself
      is blowing his trumpet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert and Pencroff left the Chimneys and turning a corner, they began
      to ascend the left bank of the river. The current was rather rapid and
      carried some dead wood. The rising tide—and it could already be felt at
      this time—must drive it back with force to a rather considerable
      distance. It occurred to the sailor that they could use this ebb and flow
      to transport heavy objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking for a quarter of an hour the sailor and the young boy
      reached the sharp bend which the river made in turning to the left. From
      this point its course passed through a forest of magnificent trees. These
      trees had kept their verdure in spite of the advanced season because they
      belonged to the family of conifers which grow in all regions of the
      globe, from the frigid climates to the tro../pics. The young naturalist
      recognized especially the “deodars,” a species very numerous in the
      Himalayan zone, which emit an agreeable odor. Among these fine trees grew
      clusters of fir trees whose opaque parasol boughs spread wide around. In
      the midst of the tall grass, Pencroff felt his feet crushing dry branches
      which crackled like fireworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good, my boy,” he said to Herbert, “if the name of these trees escapes
      me, I know at least to classify them in the category of ‘firewood’ and,
      for the moment it is the only category that we need!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us get some,” replied Herbert, who got to work at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collection was easy. It was not even necessary to break the branches
      off the trees because enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at
      their feet. But if the fuel was not wanting, the means of transportation
      left something to be desired. This wood, being very dry, would burn
      rapidly. It would therefore be necessary to carry a considerable quantity
      to the Chimneys and the load of two men would not suffice. Herbert noted
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well my boy,” replied the sailor, “there must be some way of moving this
      wood. There is always a way to do everything! If we had a cart or a boat
      it would be quite easy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But we have the river!” said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Right” replied Pencroff. “The river will be for us a road which moves
      itself and rafts were not invented for nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only” observed Herbert, “at the moment our road is going the wrong way
      since the tide is rising.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will wait till it ebbs,” replied the sailor, “and then it will be
      responsible for transporting our fuel to the Chimneys. Anyhow, let us
      prepare our raft.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, followed by Herbert, went towards the bend that the edge of
      the forest made with the river. In proportion to his strength, each
      carried a load of wood tied in faggots. On the river’s bank a large
      quantity of dead branches was also found among grass where the foot of
      man had probably never trod. Pencroff began at once to put his raft
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sort of eddy produced at one point of the bank, which broke the
      current, the sailor and the young boy placed some rather large pieces of
      wood which they had attached together with dried vines. It thus formed a
      sort of raft on which they successively piled up all the collection of
      wood, a load for at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished
      and the raft, moored to the bank, waited for the change in tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had several hours to kill and by common agreement Pencroff and
      Herbert resolved to climb to the upper plateau in order to examine the
      country for a more extended radius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred feet beyond the bend formed by the river the wall, terminated
      by a pile of rocks, sloped away gently to the border of the forest. It
      was like a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began their climb.
      Thanks to the strength of their knees they reached the crest in a few
      moments and they positioned themselves at the corner above the mouth of
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving their first glance was toward this ocean that they had
      crossed under such terrible conditions! They observed with emotion all of
      the coastline to the north where the catastrophe had occurred. It was
      there that Cyrus Smith had disappeared. They searched to see if some
      wreckage of their balloon, which a man could hang onto, was still
      floating. Nothing! The sea was a vast desert of water. As to the coast it
      too was deserted. Neither the reporter nor Neb could be seen there but it
      was possible that at this moment they were too far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Something tells me,” cried Herbert, “that a man as energetic as Mr.
      Cyrus would not allow himself to drown like a new born babe. He must have
      reached some point on the shore. Isn’t it so, Pencroff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor sadly shook his head. He hardly expected to see Cyrus Smith
      again, but he wanted to give Herbert something to hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without doubt, without doubt,” he said, “our engineer is a man able to
      get out of a situation where all others would succumb!...”
    </p>
    <p>
      However he observed the coast very carefully. Beneath them was the sandy
      shore bounded to the right of the river’s mouth by a line of breakers.
      These rocks, still emerged, resembled groups of amphibians lying in the
      surf. Beyond the strip of reefs the sea sparkled under the rays of the
      sun. In the south, a sharp point hid the horizon and one could not say if
      the land was extended in this direction, or if it oriented itself from
      southeast to southwest which would have made this coast a sort of
      elongated peninsula. Up to the extreme north of the bay the outline of
      the shore followed a more rounded contour. There the shore was low, flat,
      without cliffs, and with large sandy beaches which the ebbing tide had
      uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff and Herbert then turned to the west. First they saw a mountain
      topped by snow which rose at the distance of six or seven miles. Vast
      woods extended from the foothills of this mountain to within two miles of
      the coast enhanced by large green patches due to the presence of
      evergreens. Then, from the edge of this forest to the coast itself groups
      of trees were scattered randomly over a broad plateau. On the left they
      saw the waters of a small river sparkle trough several glades. It seemed
      that the river’s rather sinuous course led it back toward its source near
      the spurs of the mountain. At the spot where the sailor had left his raft
      of wood the watercourse began to flow between the two high granite walls.
      If, on the left bank, the wall remained sharp and abrupt, on the right
      bank, on the contrary, it sank little by little, the blocks changing to
      isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to pebbles up to the
      extremity of the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are we on an island?” murmured the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In any case it seems to be rather vast!” replied the young lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An island, however vast, will never be anything but an island!” said
      Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this important question could not yet be resolved. The answer would
      have to wait for another time. As to the land itself, island or
      continent, it seemed to be fertile, with a pleasant appearance and with a
      varied output.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is fortunate,” Pencroff noted, “and in our misfortune we should
      give thanks to Providence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “God be praised!” responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of
      gratitude to the Author of all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while Pencroff and Herbert examined this country on which
      destiny had thrown them but it was difficult to guess from this quick
      inspection what the future had in store for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they returned following the southern crest of the granite plateau,
      bordered by capricious rocks with bizarre shapes. Several hundred birds
      lived there nested in holes of the stone. Herbert, hopping over the
      rocks, made a large flock of these winged creatures fly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah,” he cried, “These are neither sea gulls nor sea mews!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what are these birds?” asked Pencroff. “Upon my word, one would say
      pigeons.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

        <b>“Then what are these birds?...”</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “Quite so, but these are wild pigeons or rock pigeons,” replied Herbert.
      “I recognize them by the double black band on their wing, by their white
      rump, and their ashen blue plumage. Now, if the rock pigeon is good to
      eat their eggs must be excellent if there are still some in their
      nests!...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will not give them time to hatch if it isn’t in the shape of an
      omelette!” replied Pencroff gleefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But in what will you make your omelette?” asked Herbert, “In your hat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied the sailor, “I am not enough of a wizard for that. We are
      forced to use eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will be in charge of
      disposing of the hardest of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff and the young lad carefully examined the crevices in the granite
      and they did in fact find eggs in some of the cavities. Several dozens
      were collected, then placed in the sailor’s handkerchief and since it was
      almost high tide they began to descend to the watercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived at the bend in the river it was one o’clock in the
      afternoon. The current had already reversed itself. It was necessary
      therefore to profit from the ebb to bring the raft of wood to the river’s
      mouth. Pencroff had no intention of letting the raft float in the current
      at random nor did he intend to board it in order to steer it. But a
      sailor is never at a loss when it is a question of cables or ropes, and
      Pencroff quickly braided a long rope several fathoms long by means of
      dried vines. This vegetable cable was attached to the back of the raft.
      The sailor wiggled his hand while Herbert pushed the raft back with a
      long pole, keeping it in the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedure succeeded as hoped. The large load of wood, which the
      sailor held on to while walking on the bank, followed the current. The
      bank was even and there was no reason to fear that the raft would run
      aground. Before two o’clock they arrived at the mouth of the river
      several paces from the Chimneys.
