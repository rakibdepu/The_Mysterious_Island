      <b class="cap">The</b> next day, the 7th of May, Cyrus Smith and Gideon
      Spilett, leaving Neb to prepare breakfast, climbed to Grand View Plateau,
      while Herbert and Pencroff went up the river in order to renew the
      provision of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer and the reporter soon arrived at this small beach situated
      at the southern point of the lake where the amphibian was stranded.
      Already flocks of birds were attacking the mass of flesh and it was
      necessary to drive them away with stones because Cyrus Smith wanted to
      save the fat from the dugong and use it for the needs of the colony. As
      to the flesh of the animal, it would not fail to furnish excellent
      nourishment. In certain Malay regions, it is especially reserved for the
      tables of the native princes. But that was Neb’s affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Cyrus Smith had other thoughts in mind. He had not
      forgotten the previous day’s incident nor had he stopped thinking about
      it. He wished to pierce the mystery of this underwater combat and to know
      what kind of mastodon or other marine monster had given the dugong so
      strange a wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there at the edge of the lake, looking and observing, but nothing
      appeared under the tranquil waters which were glistening under the first
      rays of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near this small beach which held the dugong’s body, the water was not
      very deep; but on leaving this point the bottom of the lake fell little
      by little and it was probable that at the center the depth was
      considerable. The lake could be considered as a large basin which was
      replenished by the water from Red Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then, Cyrus,” said the reporter, “it seems to me that these waters
      do not offer anything suspicious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my dear Spilett,” replied the engineer, “and I really do not know
      how to explain yesterday’s incident.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I acknowledge,” replied Gideon Spilett, “that the wound given to this
      amphibian is strange, to say the least, and neither can I explain how Top
      was so vigorously thrown out of the water. One could really believe that
      it was a powerful arm that had thrown him in this way and that this same
      arm had then killed the dugong with a dagger.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said the engineer, who became thoughtful. “There is something here
      that I cannot comprehend. But can you either understand, my dear Spilett,
      in what way I myself was saved, how I was able to pull myself from the
      waves and cross the dunes? No, isn’t it true? I have a presentiment of
      some mystery here which we will doubtless discover one day. Let us
      therefore observe but not dwell on these singular incidents in front of
      our companions. Let us keep our remarks to ourselves and continue our
      work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As we know, the engineer still had not been able to discover where the
      overflow of the lake escaped, but although he had never seen any
      indication that it overflowed, still it was necessary that an opening
      exist somewhere. Cyrus Smith was now rather surprised to perceive a
      rather pronounced current which made itself felt at this point. He threw
      in some small pieces of wood and they rapidly went toward the southern
      corner. Walking along the bank, he followed this current and he arrived
      at the southern point of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sort of depression was produced in the water there, as if it was
      abruptly lost in some fissure in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith listened, placing his ear at the level of the lake, and he
      very distinctly heard the noise of a subterranean falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is there,” he said, getting up, “there that the water discharges,
      there doubtless by a conduit excavated in the granite mass that the water
      rejoins the sea, through some cavities which we will use to our benefit.
      Yes, I will uncover it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer cut a long branch, removed its leaves, and plunging it in at
      the corner between the two banks, he found that there existed an open
      hole only a foot under the surface of the water. This hole was the
      opening to the passageway vainly sought until then. The force of the
      current was such that the branch was torn from the engineer’s hands and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is no longer any doubt now,” repeated Cyrus Smith. “There is the
      entrance to the passageway and I will open it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “By lowering the level of the lake by three feet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how will you lower the level?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By making a larger opening than this one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where, Cyrus?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the part of the bank that is closest to the coast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it is a bank of granite,” noted the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied Cyrus Smith, “then I will blow up this granite, and the
      water, by escaping, will uncover this opening...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And form a waterfall which will fall on the beach,” added the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A fall which we will utilize,” replied Cyrus. “Come, come!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer inspired his companion, whose confidence in Cyrus Smith was
      such that he did not doubt that the enterprise would succeed.
      Nevertheless, how would he disintegrate this bank of granite rocks
      without powder and with imperfect instruments? Wasn’t he attacking a
      problem beyond his resources?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cyrus Smith and the reporter returned to the Chimneys, they found
      Herbert and Pencroff occupied with unloading their wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The woodsmen are finishing up, Mister Cyrus,” said the sailor laughing,
      “and when you need masons...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Masons, no, but chemists ,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” added the reporter, “we will blow up the island...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blow up the island!” cried Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A part of it, at any rate,” replied Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen to me, my friends,” said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he made known to them the results of his observations. According to
      him, a more or less considerable cavity existed inside the mass of
      granite that supported Grand View Plateau and he intended to penetrate
      it. To do this, it was first necessary to clear the opening through which
      the water ran, and consequently to lower its level by making a larger
      opening. To do that, it was necessary to manufacture an explosive
      substance which could make a large opening at another point of the bank.
      It was this that Cyrus Smith was going to attempt by means of the
      minerals which nature had placed at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to tell of the enthusiasm with which everyone, especially
      Pencroff, greeted this project. To use grand methods, rip open this
      granite, create a cascade, that appealed to the sailor. And he could just
      as easily be a chemist as a mason or a bootmaker since the engineer
      needed chemists. He would be anything that was wanted “even a professor
      of dance and deportment” he said to Neb, if that was ever necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Pencroff were first directed to extract the fat from the dugong
      and to save its flesh, which was intended for food. They soon left
      without even asking for an explanation. Their confidence in the engineer
      was absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, Cyrus Smith, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, dragging
      the hurdle and going up the river, went toward the bed of coal where
      schistous pyrites abounded. This was located among the more recent
      transition terrains where Cyrus Smith had already discovered a sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire day was employed in carting a certain quantity of these
      pyrites to the Chimneys. By evening they had several tons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations. These
      schistous pyrites being principally composed of carbon, silicone,
      aluminum and iron sulphide, the latter in excess, he had to isolate the
      iron sulphide and transform it into sulphate as quickly as possible. The
      sulphate obtained, he could then extract sulphuric acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      This in fact was the goal to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the
      most used agents, and the industrial importance of a nation can be
      measured by the consumption which is made of it. Later this acid would be
      very useful to the colonists in making candles, in the tanning of pelts,
      etc., but at the moment the engineer was reserving it for another use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith chose a location behind the Chimneys where the ground was
      carefully leveled. On this ground he placed a pile of branches and
      chopped wood on top of which were placed lumps of schistous pyrites
      supporting one another. Then he covered everything with a thin layer of
      pyrites previously reduced to walnut size.
    </p>
    <p>
      That done, they set fire to the wood and the schists began to burn since
      they contained carbon and sulphur. Then new layers of crushed pyrites
      were put on to form an enormous pile. The exterior was covered with earth
      and grass after they had arranged some air vents, as if they were
      carbonizing a stack of wood to make charcoal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they let the transformation proceed of its own accord and it needed
      not less than ten to twelve days for the iron sulphide to change into
      iron sulphate and the aluminum into aluminum sulphate, two substances
      equally soluble, the others, silicon, charcoal and cinders not being so.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this chemical activity was going on, Cyrus Smith proceeded with
      other operations which were tackled by more than zeal. It was
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Pencroff had removed the fat from the dugong and collected it in
      large earthen jars. They now had to isolate one of its elements,
      glycerin, by saponifying it. Now to obtain this result, it suffices to
      treat it with soda or with lime. In fact, one or the other of these
      substances, after having attacked the grease, would form a soap thereby
      isolating the glycerin and it was precisely this glycerin that the
      engineer wished to obtain. As we know, lime was not lacking, but the
      treatment with lime would only give a lime soap, which was insoluble and
      consequently useless, whereas the treatment with soda would furnish, on
      the contrary, a soluble soap which would find use for domestic cleaning.
      Now, as a practical man, Cyrus Smith would rather try to obtain the soda.
      Was this difficult? No, because marine plants abounded on the shore,
      salicornia, ficoids and all those fucaceae which form the seaweed and the
      wrack. They therefore collected a large quantity of these plants, dried
      them first and burnt them in a pit in the open air. The combustion of
      these plants was kept up for several days so that the rising heat would
      fuze the cinders. The result of this incineration was a compact grayish
      mass, which for a long time has been known under the name of “natural
      soda.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This result obtained, the engineer treated the grease with the soda,
      which gave on the one hand a soluble soap, and on the other hand this
      neutral substance, glycerin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not all. In view of his future preparation, Cyrus Smith
      still needed another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known
      under the name of potassium nitrate, or saltpeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith would have been able to make this substance by treating
      potassium carbonate, which is easily extracted from the cinders of
      plants, using nitric acid. But nitric acid was lacking and it was
      precisely this acid that he wished to obtain in the end. It was therefore
      a vicious circle that he would never leave. Very fortunately this time,
      nature furnished him with the saltpeter without which he would have been
      at quite a loss. Herbert discovered a bed in the north of the island at
      the foot of Mount Franklin, and they had nothing more to do but to purify
      this salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      These various activities lasted for about eight days. They were finished
      before the transformation of the sulphide into iron sulphate was
      completed. During the days which followed, the colonists had time to make
      refractory pottery from plastic clay and to construct a brick furnace for
      the specific purpose of distilling the iron sulphate when that would be
      obtained. All this was completed about the 18th of May, a little before
      the chemical transformations were ended. Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb and
      Pencroff, ably directed by the engineer, became the most skillful workmen
      in the world. Of all masters, necessity is moreover the one that we
      listen to the most, and the one that teaches best.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the pile of pyrites had been entirely reduced by the fire, the
      result of the operation consisted of iron sulphate, aluminum sulphate,
      silica, and a residue of charcoal and cinders which were placed in a
      basin full of water. They shook this mixture, let it settle, then on
      decanting it they obtained a clear liquid containing a solution of iron
      sulphate and aluminum sulphate, the other materials remaining as solids
      since they are insoluble. Finally, this liquid was vaporized in part,
      depositing the iron sulphate crystals. The original liquid, that is to
      say the nonvaporized portion which contained the aluminum sulphate, was
      abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith thus had at his disposal a rather large quantity of iron
      sulphate crystals from which he would obtain sulphuric acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In industrial practice the manufacture of sulphuric acid requires a
      costly installation. In fact, it is necessary to have a large plant,
      special equipment, platinum apparatus, lead chambers which are not
      attacked by the acid in which to perform the operation, etc. The engineer
      did not have this equipment available but he knew that in Bohemia
      particularly they make sulphuric acid by a more simple means which also
      has the advantage of producing a high degree of concentration. It is
      known under the name of Nordhausen acid.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Smith had only one operation to perform,
      to burn the iron sulphate crystals in a closed vessel so that the
      sulphuric acid would distill in a vapor and the vapor would then produce
      the acid by condensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this manipulation they used the refractory pottery, in which they
      placed the crystals, and the forge, whose heat would distill the
      sulphuric acid. The operation was conducted perfectly and on the 20th of
      May, twelve days after having begun, the engineer possessed the agent
      that he counted on using later in various ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now why did he want to have this agent? Very simply to produce nitric
      acid which was easy since the saltpeter, attacked by the sulphuric acid,
      would give him precisely this acid by distillation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But finally what would he do with this nitric acid? His companions were
      still ignorant of this because he did not tell them about this last
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the engineer was within sight of his goal and one last operation
      would give him the substance that had taken so much effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having taken the nitric acid and placed it in the presence of the
      glycerin, which had been previously concentrated by evaporation using a
      boiler, he obtained, even without using a cooler, several pints of an
      oily and yellowish liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last operation Cyrus Smith performed alone in a remote place far
      from the Chimneys because it presented the dangers of explosion, and when
      he brought a container of this liquid to his friends, he was content to
      say to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is nitroglycerin.”
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/223.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>“This is nitroglycerin.”</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      It was, in fact, this terrible product whose explosive power is perhaps
      tenfold that of ordinary powder and which has already caused so many
      accidents. Nevertheless, the means has since been found to transform it
      into dynamite, that is to say to mix it with a rather porous solid
      substance, clay or sugar, to retain it, so that the dangerous liquid can
      be used with more security. But dynamite was not yet known at the time
      the colonists were working on Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it is this liquid which will blow up our rock?” asked Pencroff,
      rather incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and this nitroglycerin will
      produce such an effect that this extremely hard granite will be opposed
      by a larger explosive force.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And when will we see this, Mister Cyrus?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tomorrow, after we have dug a hole for a mine,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners returned to the
      point which was formed by the banks of Lake Grant and only five hundred
      feet from the coast. At this spot, the plateau was lower than the water
      which was held in place only by the granite frame. It was therefore
      evident that if they broke this frame, the water would escape by this
      opening and form a stream which, after flowing on the inclined surface of
      the plateau, would fall on the beach. This would then lower the general
      level of the lake which would uncover the opening of the passageway which
      was their final goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore the frame that they must break. Under the engineer’s
      direction, Pencroff, armed with a pick which he handled skillfully and
      vigorously, attacked the granite on its exterior face. The hole that he
      made took shape on a horizontal edge of the bank, excavated obliquely to
      produce a level appreciably lower than the water of the lake. In this way
      the explosive force would break the rock, permitting the water to escape
      freely to the outside and consequently lower its level sufficiently.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/225.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>Pencroff, armed with a pick...</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      The work took a long time because the engineer, wanting to produce a
      formidable effect, did not count on using less than ten liters of
      nitroglycerin for the operation. But Pencroff, relieved by Neb, did so
      well that by about four o’clock in the afternoon, the hole for the mine
      was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There still remained the problem of igniting the explosive substance.
      Ordinarily nitroglycerin is ignited by means of a fulminate primer which,
      on bursting, sets off the explosion. In fact, a shock is needed to
      provoke the explosion, and if it is simply set aflame, this substance
      will burn without exploding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith would certainly have been able to make a primer. In default
      of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance analogous to
      cottonpowder, since he had nitric acid available. This substance, pressed
      into a cartridge and introduced into the nitroglycerin, would ignite by
      means of a fuze and set off the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cyrus Smith knew that nitroglycerin has the property of detonating
      under shock. He therefore resolved to utilize this property, but he would
      use another means if this one did not succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the shock from a hammer on a few drops of nitroglycerin
      sprinkled on the surface of a hard stone suffices to induce the
      explosion. But the operator cannot be there to give the blow of the
      hammer without becoming victim to the operation. Cyrus Smith then thought
      of suspending a mass of iron weighing several pounds onto a post above
      the hole of the mine by means of a vegetable fiber. Another long fiber,
      previously dipped in sulphur, was attached by one of its extremities to
      the middle of the first fiber while the other extremity trailed along the
      ground to a distance of several feet from the hole of the mine. The fire
      being kindled to this second fiber, it would burn until it reached the
      first. This one, then catching fire in its turn, would break and the mass
      of iron would fall on the nitroglycerin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This apparatus was so installed; then the engineer, after having
      dismissed his companions, filled the hole of the mine so that the
      nitroglycerin came up to the top and he threw a few drops on the surface
      of the rock below the suspended mass of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      That done, Cyrus Smith took the end of the sulphurized fiber, lit it, and
      leaving the place, he returned to his companions in the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/228.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>And, leaving the place, Cyrus Smith...</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      The fiber was set to burn for twenty five minutes and, in fact, twenty
      five minutes later an explosion resounded, impossible to describe. It
      seemed that the entire island trembled on its base. Rocks flew up as if
      vomited from a volcano. The vibration produced by the displaced air was
      such that the rocks at the Chimneys oscillated. The colonists, even
      though they were more than two miles from the mine, were thrown to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got up, climbed to the plateau and ran to the spot where the edge of
      the lake had been ripped open by the explosion...
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hurrahs escaped from their chests. The granite frame split over a
      large area. A rapid stream of water was escaping through it, flowing and
      foaming across the plateau, and upon reaching the crest it fell from a
      height of three hundred feet on to the beach.
