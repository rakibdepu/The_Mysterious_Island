      <b class="cap">“Well,</b> Mister Cyrus, where shall we begin?” Pencroff
      asked the engineer the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the beginning,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the colonists had to really begin at the beginning. They did not
      even possess the tools needed to make tools and they did not even find
      themselves in the position of Nature which “having time, economizes on
      effort.” They had no time since they had to provide immediately for the
      needs of their existence, and if profiting from acquired experience they
      had nothing to invent, none the less they had everything to make. Their
      iron, their steel was still only in the mineral state, their pottery was
      in the clay state, their linen and clothes were in the state of textile
      materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be said however that these colonists were “men” in the true sense
      of the word. The engineer Smith could not have been seconded by more
      intelligent companions nor with more devotion and zeal. He had tried
      them. He knew their strengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, a reporter of great talent, having learnnd everything,
      could speak about everything and could contribute with his mind and body
      to the colonization of the island. He would not recoil before any task
      and, being a passionate hunter, he would make a business out of what had
      been until then a sport for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, a courageous lad, already remarkably instructed in the natural
      sciences, would make a substantial contribution to the common cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb was devotion personified. Skillful, intelligent, tireless, robust,
      with a constitution of iron, he understood a little about the work of the
      forge and would be very useful to the colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Pencroff, he had sailed on all the oceans, a carpenter in the
      Brooklyn dockyards, a tailor’s aide in the Navy, gardener, farmer during
      his furloughs, etc., and like a man of the sea, prepared for everything
      and knowing how to do everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would truly be difficult to unite five men more suitable to battle
      fate and more assured of triumphing against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the beginning,” Cyrus Smith had said. Now this beginning that the
      engineer referred to was the construction of an apparatus which would
      serve to transform natural substances. It is known that heat plays a role
      in these transformations. Now the fuel, wood or coal, was available for
      immediate use. They must proceed to make a furnace for using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the purpose of the furnace?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To make the pottery that we need,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And with what will we make the furnace ?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With bricks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the bricks?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With clay. Let’s go, my friends. In order to avoid transportation
      problems we will establish our workshop at the very place of production.
      Neb will bring the provisions and there will be no lack of fire for
      cooking food.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the reporter, “but if there is to be no lack of food then
      we will have to make some hunting weapons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! If we only had a knife,” cried the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What then?” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then I would quickly make a bow and arrows and there would be plenty of
      game in the pantry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, a knife, a sharp blade...,” the engineer said as if speaking to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he turned his attention toward Top who was prowling around
      the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Cyrus Smith became excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, Top,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog ran up at his master’s call. He took Top’s head between his
      hands, detached the collar that the animal carried on his neck and broke
      it in two parts, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here are two knives, Pencroff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor responded with two hurrahs. Top’s collar was made of a thin
      blade of tempered steel. It was sufficient to first grind it on a
      sandstone so as to give it a keen sharp edge and then to raise the edge
      on a finer sandstone. Now this type of sandy rock was met with in
      abundance on the beach and two hours later the colony’s stock of tools
      was composed of two sharp blades which had been easy to fit into sturdy
      handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conquest of this first tool was saluted like a triumph, a precious
      conquest indeed which would come in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left. It was Cyrus Smith’s intention to return to the eastern shore
      of the lake. There he had noticed on the previous day this clay soil, a
      sample of which he had. They took to the bank of the Mercy, crossed Grand
      View Plateau and after a walk of five miles at most they arrived at a
      clearing situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way Herbert discovered a tree whose branches are used by the
      Indians of South America to make their bows. It was the “crejimba” of the
      palm tree family which does not bear edible fruit. Some long straight
      branches were cut, stripped of leaves, pruned, made thicker in the center
      and thinner at the extremities, and they had only to find a suitable
      plant for the cord of the bow. This was a species belonging to the mallow
      family, the “hibiscus heterophyllus” which furnishes fibers of remarkable
      tenacity that can be compared to the tendons of animals. Pencroff thus
      obtained some rather strong bows for which he only needed arrows. These
      were easy to make with some straight and rigid branches without knots but
      the point would have to be armed, that is to say with a substance
      suitable for replacing the iron which would not be easy to meet with. But
      Pencroff said that having done his share of the work, chance would do the
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists arrived on terrain that they recognized from the previous
      day. It was composed of this figuline clay which serves in making bricks
      and tiles, clay which consequently would be very useful in carrying out
      the operation in question. The manual labor required would not present
      any difficulty. It sufficed to thin this fuguline with some sand, to mold
      the bricks and to bake them in the heat of a wood fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily bricks are pressed into molds but the engineer was content to
      form them by hand. All that day and the following were employed with this
      work. The clay, mixed with water, was then puddled with the hands and
      feet of the manipulators and divided into blocks of equal size. A skilled
      workman could make, without a machine, up to ten thousand bricks in
      twelve hours but in their two days of work the five brickmakers of
      Lincoln Island made not more than three thousand which were arranged
      alongside each other until the time, three or four days later, when their
      complete drying would permit them to perform the baking.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/163.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>Three thusand bricks were arranged...</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      On April 2nd Cyrus Smith determined the position of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the previous evening he had noted exactly the time when the sun had
      disappeared below the horizon, taking account of refraction. This morning
      he noted no less exactly the time when it reappeared. Between this
      setting and this rising twelve hours less twenty four minutes elapsed.
      Thus six hours and twelve minutes after today’s sunrise the sun would
      exactly pass the meridian and the point in the sky that it would occupy
      at that moment would be north. <sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the indicated hour Cyrus noted this point by lining up two trees with
      the sun which would serve as a reference mark. He thus obtained a fixed
      meridian for subsequent operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two days preceding the baking of the bricks were occupied with
      providing fuel. They cut off branches around the clearing and gathered
      all the wood that had fallen under the trees. This was not done without a
      little hunting in the vicinity now done better since Pencroff possessed
      several dozen arrows armed with very sharp points. It was Top who had
      furnished these points. He brought in a porcupine, rather mediocre as
      food, but of incontestable value thanks to the quills with which it was
      studded. These quills were securely attached to the ends of the arrows
      whose stability was assured by a tail made with the feathers of
      cockatoos. The reporter and Herbert promptly became skillful archers.
      Then hairy and feathery game were abundant at the Chimneys, capybaras,
      pigeons, agoutis, heather cocks, etc. For the most part these animals
      were killed in the part of the forest situated on the left bank of the
      Mercy to which they gave the name Jacamar Woods in remembrance of the
      bird that Pencroff and Herbert had pursued during their first
      exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      This game was eaten fresh but they saved the legs of the capybara which
      they smoked over a fire of green wood after having aromatized it with
      fragrant leaves. This nourishment was fortifying but nevertheless it was
      always roast upon roast and the diners would have been happy to hear on
      the hearth the sound of beef boiling, but they would have to wait until
      the pot was made and consequently until the oven was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these excursions, which were only made within a restricted radius
      around the brickyard, the hunters were able to verify the recent passage
      of large animals with powerful claws of a species they did not recognize.
      Cyrus Smith urged them to be extremely prudent because it was likely that
      the forest concealed several dangerous animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was well that they did. In fact one day Gideon Spilett and Herbert
      saw an animal that resembled a jaguar. This animal fortunately did not
      attack them because they perhaps would not have gotten away without some
      serious wound. But as soon as they could have a real weapon, that is to
      say one of the guns that Pencroff clamored for, Gideon Spilett vowed an
      intense war against the ferocious beasts to purge them from the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these days the Chimneys were not made more comfortable because the
      engineer counted on discovering or building, if necessary, a more
      convenient dwelling. They were content to spread a fresh litter of moss
      and dry leaves on the sand of the passageways and on these somewhat
      primitive beds the weary workers slept a perfect sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also noted the days which passed on Lincoln Island from the time
      that the colonists first set foot there, and kept a regular count. The
      fifth of April, which was a Wednesday, was twelve days from the time that
      the storm had thrown the castaways on this shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixth of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions
      gathered at the clearing in the vicinity of where the brick baking
      operation would take place. Naturally this kind of operation had to be
      done in the open air instead of in a furnace or rather in this
      conglomeration of bricks which would only be an enormous furnace which
      would bake itself. The fuel, made of well prepared faggots, was placed on
      the ground surrounded by several rows of dry bricks, soon forming a large
      cube, with air vents leading to the outside. This work lasted the entire
      day and only by evening did they set fire to the faggots.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night no one went to bed and they watched carefully that the fire
      did not slacken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation lasted forty eight hours and was a perfect success. It was
      then necessary to let the smoking mass cool. During this time Neb and
      Pencroff, guided by Cyrus Smith, used a hurdle of interlacing branches to
      transport several loads of limestone, very ordinary stones, which they
      found abundant north of the lake. These stones, decomposed by the heat,
      gave a very slimy quicklime with a yield increased by slaking, as pure in
      the end as if it had been produced by the calcination of chalk or of
      marble. Mixed with sand, which has the effect of reducing the contraction
      of the paste when it solidifies, this limestone furnished an excellent
      mortar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of these various works was that on April 9th the engineer had
      at his disposal a certain quantity of fully prepared lime and several
      thousand bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without losing an instant they then began the construction of a kiln
      which would serve to bake the various potteries indispensable for
      domestic use. They succeeded without too much difficulty. Five days later
      the kiln was charged with coal discovered by the engineer in an open bed
      near the mouth of Red Creek. The first smoke escaped from a chimney about
      twenty feet high. The clearing was transformed into a factory and
      Pencroff was not far from believing that from this kiln would issue all
      the products of modern industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting, the first thing that the colonists made was an ordinary
      pot but one very useful for cooking food. The main material was clay soil
      to which Cyrus Smith added a little lime and quartz. In reality this
      paste constitutes the real “pipe clay” from which they made pots, cups
      which had been molded on pottery wheels of the appropriate form, plates,
      large jars and vats for holding water, etc. The form of these objects was
      awkward and defective; but after they had been fired at a high
      temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys found itself provided with a
      certain number of utensils as precious as if the most beautiful kaolin
      had been used in its composition.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/167.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>The colonists made an ordinary pot.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      It should be mentioned here that Pencroff, desiring to know if this clay,
      so prepared, justified its name of “pipe clay,” made some rather
      grotesque pipes which he found charming but since tobacco was missing,
      alas! And, it should be said, this was a large deprivation for Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the tobacco will come like everything else,” he repeated during his
      outbursts of absolute confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tasks lasted until April 15th and one can be sure that this time
      was conscientiously employed. The colonists, having become potters, did
      no other thing except pottery. When it would be convenient for Cyrus
      Smith to change them to forgers, they would be forgers. But the next day
      was Sunday, Easter Sunday no less, and all agreed to sanctify this day by
      rest. These Americans were religious men, scrupulous observers of the
      precepts of the bible and the situation that they found themselves in
      could only develop their confidence in the Author of all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 15th of April they definitely returned to the
      Chimneys. The rest of the pottery was carried away and the kiln was
      extinguished to await a new use. The return was marked by a happy
      incident, the discovery made by the engineer of a substance suited to
      replace tinder. It is known that this spongy and velvety pulp comes from
      a certain mushroom of the polypore genus. Properly prepared it is
      extremely inflammable especially when it has been previously saturated
      with cannon powder or boiled in a solution of nitrate or potassium
      chlorate. But up to that time they had not found any of these polypores
      nor even morels which can replace them. On this day the engineer, having
      recognized a certain plant that belongs to the artemisia genus, which
      counts among its principle species wormwood, citronella, tarragon, etc.,
      tore off several clumps and presented them to the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep these, Pencroff,” he said. “Here is something that will please
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff looked at the plant attentively, lined with a lengthy and silky
      down, whose leaves were covered with a fluffy cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, what is this Mister Cyrus?” asked Pencroff. “Good heavens, is it
      tobacco?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Cyrus Smith, “it is artemisia, Chinese artemisia for the
      scientists but for us it will be tinder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact this artemisia, properly dried, furnishes a very inflammable
      substance especially when later the engineer would impregnate it with
      potassium nitrate of which the island possessed several beds and which is
      nothing more than saltpeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening all the colonists were gathered in the main room and ate in
      style. Neb had prepared a broth of agouti, a fragrant capybara ham to
      which was added boiled tubercules of the “caladium macrophizum,” a sort
      of herbaceous plant of the family of aroids which, in the tropical zone,
      take on an arborescent form. These rhizomes had an excellent taste, very
      nutritious, and nearly like the substance that is sold in England under
      the name of “Portland Sago.” This could, to a certain degree, replace
      bread which was still lacking to the colonists of Lincoln Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper was finished but before surrendering themselves to slumber,
      Cyrus Smith and his companions went to get some fresh air on the beach.
      It was eight o’clock. The night promised to be magnificent. The moon,
      which had been full five days earlier, had not yet risen but already the
      horizon was silvered with the soft gentle hues that could be called the
      lunar dawn. At the southern zenith the polar constellations glistened and
      among them was the Southern Cross which the engineer had greeted several
      days earlier on the top of Mount Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith observed this splendid constellation for some time, which was
      composed on its upper portion and on its lower portion of two stars of
      the first magnitude, on its left arm a star of the second and on its
      right arm a star of the third magnitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after thinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Herbert,” he asked the lad, “Isn’t this the 15th of April?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Mister Cyrus,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then, if I am not mistaken, tomorrow will be one of the four days
      in the year when the true time will coincide with the average time, that
      is to say, my child, that tomorrow, within a few seconds, the sun will
      cross the meridian at noon, by the clock. If the weather is nice I think
      that I will be able to obtain the longitude of the island to an
      approximation of several degrees.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without instruments or a sextant?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied the engineer. “Also, since the night is clear I am going
      to try this very night to obtain our latitude by calculating the height
      of the Southern Cross, that is to say of the southern pole above the
      horizon. You can well appreciate, my friends, that before undertaking
      serious work on getting settled, it not only suffices to know that this
      land is an island but it is also necessary to know, if possible, at what
      distance it is situated either from the American continent, or the
      Australian continent or the principal archipelagos of the Pacific.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact,” said the reporter, “instead of constructing a house we could
      be more interested in constructing a boat if by chance we are only about
      a hundred miles from some inhabited coast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is why,” replied Cyrus Smith, “I am going to try this evening to
      obtain the latitude of Lincoln Island and tomorrow at noon I will try to
      calculate its longitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus which permits, by
      reflection, the high precision measurement of the angular distance
      between objects, the operation would have offered no difficulty. This
      night by the height of the pole, the next day by the sun’s crossing of
      the meridian, he would have obtained the coordinates of the island. But
      with the apparatus missing, he had to supply it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith therefore returned to the Chimneys. By the light from the
      hearth he carved two small flat rulers that he attached together at their
      extremities so as to form a sort of compass whose branches could open or
      close. The point of attachment was secured by means of a strong thorn
      from an acacia which was part of the dead wood in the woodpile.
    </p>
    <p>
      This instrument completed, the engineer returned to the beach, but he had
      to take the height of the pole above a clearly defined horizon, that is
      to say the horizon of the sea. However, Cape Claw hid the southern
      horizon so he would have to find a more convenient station. The best
      would evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south but for
      this it would be necessary to cross the Mercy, then in darkness, which
      would be a difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, Cyrus Smith resolved to make his observations from Grand
      View Plateau and to take into account its height above sea level, a
      height which he would calculate the next day by a simple procedure of
      elementary geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists therefore went to the plateau by ascending the left bank of
      the Mercy and placed themselves on the edge that was oriented northwest
      to southeast, that is to say on this line of capriciously cut rocks which
      bordered the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      This part of the plateau was fifty feet higher than the right bank which
      sloped down to the extremity of Cape Claw and to the southern coast of
      the island. No obstacle interfered with their view which embraced the
      horizon from the Cape to Reptile Promontory. In the south this horizon
      was illuminated from below by the first rays of the moon vividly
      delineated on the sky, enabling them to sight it with a certain
      precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an
      upside down position, the star Alpha marking its base, being the closest
      to the southern pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      This constellation is not situated as close to the antarctic pole as the
      pole star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about 27 degrees from
      it, but Cyrus Smith knew this and would take account of this angle in his
      calculation. He was also careful to observe the moment when it passed its
      lowest meridian which would render his observation easier.

      Cyrus Smith therefore lined up one branch of his wooden compass with the
      horizon of the sea, the other on Alpha, as he would have done with
      circular eyepieces, and the opening between the two branches gave him the
      angular distance that separated Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix
      the angle obtained in an immutable way, he fastened the two slats of his
      apparatus by means of thorns using a third slat placed transversely such
      that their separation was firmly maintained.

    <p>
      That done, it remained only to calculate the angle obtained by correcting
      the observation to the level of the sea in a manner to take account of
      the depression of the horizon which necessitated the measurement of the
      height of the plateau. The value of this angle would thus give the height
      of Alpha and consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to
      say the latitude of the island, since the latitude of a point on the
      globe is always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon at this
      point.

      These calculations were left for the next day and at ten o’clock everyone
      was in a deep sleep.
