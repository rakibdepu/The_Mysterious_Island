    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">These</b> last words justified the colonists’
      premonitions. There was some past disaster in this unfortunate’s life,
      expiated perhaps in the eyes of men, but his conscience had still not
      absolved him. In any case, the criminal was remorseful, he repented, but
      this hand that was asked of him, which his new friends would have
      cordially grasped, he did not feel worthy to offer to honest men.
      Nevertheless, after the scene with the jaguar, he did not return to the
      forest and after this day he did not leave the Granite House area.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was his mystery? Would the stranger speak of it one day? The future
      would tell. In any event it was agreed that they would never ask him
      about his secret and that they would live with him as if they suspected
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days the community life continued as it had always been.
      Cyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett worked together sometimes as chemists and
      sometimes as physicists. The reporter left the engineer only to hunt with
      Herbert because it would not have been prudent to let the lad roam the
      forest alone, and they had to be on guard. As to Neb and Pencroff, one
      day at the stables or at the poultry yard, another at the corral, without
      counting the tasks at Granite House, they had no lack of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger worked alone and he resumed his usual existence, never
      present at mealtime, sleeping under some trees on the plateau and never
      mingling with his companions. It truly seemed that the society of those
      who had saved him was unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But then,” noted Pencroff, “why did he ask for the help of his fellow
      men? Why did he throw this document into the sea?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He will tell us,” Cyrus Smith invariably replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact, the confession day was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House, Cyrus
      Smith saw the stranger coming to him. With a calm voice and a humble tone
      he said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, I have a request to ask of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speak,” replied the engineer, “but first let me ask you a question.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the stranger blushed and was on the point of leaving.
      Cyrus Smith understood what was passing in the guilty man’s soul. He was
      doubtless afraid that the engineer would question him about his past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith held him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Comrade,” he said to him, “not only are we your companions but we are
      your friends. I insist on saying this to you and now I will listen to
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger passed his hands over his eyes. He trembled and for a few
      moments he could not say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” he finally said, “I came to beg you to grant me a favor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Four or five miles from here, at the foot of the mountain, you have a
      corral for your domestic animals. These animals need to be cared for.
      Will you permit me to live there with them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith looked at the unfortunate for a few moments with a sentiment
      of deep commiseration. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” he said, “the corral only has stables hardly fit for
      animals...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It will be good enough for me, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” replied Cyrus Smith, “we will never interfere with you on
      anything. It pleases you to live at the corral. So be it. You will,
      however, always be welcome at Granite House. But since you wish to live
      at the corral we will make the necessary arrangements for your comfort.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not important. I will always manage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” replied Cyrus Smith, who purposely insisted on this cordial
      appellation, “let us judge what we ought to do in this regard.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you, sir” replied the stranger on leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer immediately told his companions about the proposition that
      had been made to him and it was decided that they would construct a
      wooden house at the corral and that they would make it as comfortable as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very day the colonists went to the corral with the necessary tools
      and a week had not passed when the house was ready to receive its host.
      It had been raised some twenty feet above the stables and from there it
      would be easy to keep surveillance over the mouflon flocks which then
      counted more than eighty head. Some furniture, a bed, a table, a bench, a
      wardrobe and a chest were made, and weapons, munitions and tools were
      brought to the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger however had not seen his new dwelling and he had allowed the
      colonists to work there without him, while he occupied himself on the
      plateau wanting doubtless to put the last touch on his work. As a matter
      of fact, thanks to him, the entire ground had been worked and was ready
      to be sowed as soon as the time would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 20th of December that these arrangements had been completed at
      the corral. The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling was
      ready to receive him and the latter replied that he would sleep there
      that very night.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the colonists were gathered in the large hall of Granite
      House. It was then eight o’clock when their companion was about to leave.
      Not wanting to inconvenience him by the need to say goodbye, which would
      perhaps be difficult for him, they had left him alone and had gone up to
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been chatting for a few moments in the large hall when a light
      knock was heard on the door. Almost immediately the stranger entered and
      without any other preamble:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen,” he said, “before I leave you, it is best that you know my
      story. Here it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      These simple words did not fail to vividly impress Cyrus Smith and his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We ask nothing of you, my friend,” he said. “You have the right to
      remain silent...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is my duty to speak.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be seated then.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will remain standing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are ready to listen to you,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger stood in a corner of the room, a little in the shadows. His
      head was bare, his arms crossed on his chest and it was in this posture
      that, in a muffled voice, speaking like someone who was forcing himself
      to speak, he made the following recital which his listeners did not once
      interrupt.
    </p>

    <p>
      “On the 20th of December 1854, the steam pleasure yacht, the
      <i>Duncan</i>, belonging to the Scotch nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, dropped
      anchor off Cape Bernouilli on the western coast of Australia on the 37th
      parallel. On board this yacht were Lord Glenarvan, his wife, a major of
      the English army, a French geographer, a young girl and a young boy.
      These last two were the children of Captain Grant whose vessel, the
      <i>Britannia</i>, had been lost, men and cargo, the previous year. The
      <i>Duncan</i> was commanded by Captain John Mangles and carried a crew of
      fifteen men.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is the reason that the yacht found itself off the coast of
      Australia at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Six months earlier a bottle enclosing a document written in English, in
      German, and in French had been found in the Irish Sea and picked up by
      the <i>Duncan</i>. This document stated in substance that there still
      were three survivors from the wreck of the <i>Britannia</i>, that these
      survivors were Captain Grant and two of his men and that they had found
      refuge on a land whose latitude was given by the document but whose
      longitude was no longer legible, having been erased by the sea water.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This latitude was 37°11′ South. Thus, the longitude being unknown, if
      they followed this thirty seventh parallel across the continents and the
      seas, they were certain to reach the land inhabited by Captain Grant and
      his two companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The English admiralty having hesitated to undertake this search, Lord
      Glenarvan decided to attempt to find the captain himself. Mary and Robert
      Grant had been put in touch with him. The yacht, the <i>Duncan</i>, was
      equipped for a long voyage in which the lord’s family and the captain’s
      children would take part, and the <i>Duncan</i>, leaving Glasgow, crossed
      the Atlantic, doubled the Straits of Magellan and went up the Pacific to
      Patagonia where, according to a first interpretation of the document,
      they had thought that Captain Grant was a prisoner of the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Duncan</i> disembarked its passengers on the western coast of
      Patagonia and left in order to pick them up again on the eastern coast at
      Cape Corrientes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord Glenarvan crossed Patagonia following the thirty seventh parallel
      and not having found any trace of the captain, he embarked again on the
      13th of November, in order to pursue his search across the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan de Acunha and
      Amsterdam, situated on his course, the <i>Duncan</i> as I have said,
      arrived at Cape Bernouilli on the Australian coast on the 20th of
      December 1854.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was the intention of Lord Glenarvan to cross Australia as he had
      crossed America and he disembarked. A few miles from the shore was a farm
      belonging to an Irishman who offered his hospitality to the travelers.
      Lord Glenarvan acquainted this Irishman with the reasons that had brought
      him to these parts and he asked him if he knew about the three masted
      English vessel, the <i>Britannia</i>, which was lost less than two years
      earlier on the western coast of Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Irishman had never heard anyone speak about this wreck; but, to the
      great surprise of those present, one of the Irishman’s employees
      intervened and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘My lord, praise and thank God. If Captain Grant is still living, he is
      living on Australian soil.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Who are you?’ asked Lord Glenarvan.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,’ replied this man, ‘and I am one of
      the companions of Captain Grant, one of the castaways of the
      <i>Britannia</i>.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “This man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the first mate of the
      <i>Britannia</i> as certified by his papers. But, separated from Captain
      Grant at the moment when the vessel was wrecked on the reef, he had
      believed until then that his captain had perished along with the entire
      crew and that it was he, Ayrton, who was the only survivor of the
      <i>Britannia</i>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/541.jpg" border="1" width="320" height="465" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b class="cap">Ayrton.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “‘Only,’ he added, ‘it was not on the west coast but on the east coast of
      Australia that the <i>Britannia</i> was lost and if Captain Grant is
      still living, as the document indicates, then he is a prisoner of the
      Australian natives and it is on the other coast that you must look for
      him.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “This man spoke with a clear voice and with an assured look. They did not
      doubt his words. The Irishman, in whose service he had been for a year,
      vouched for him. Lord Glenarvan believed in this man’s honesty and thanks
      to his advice, he resolved to cross Australia following the 37th
      parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his wife, the two children, the major, the
      Frenchman, Captain Mangles and several mates made up the small group
      under Ayrton’s direction while the <i>Duncan</i>, commanded by the second
      mate, Tom Austin, went to Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan’s
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They left on the 23rd of December 1854.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is time to say that this Ayrton was a traitor. He was in fact the
      first mate of the <i>Britannia</i>, but after discussions with his
      captain he had tried to stir the crew to revolt and seize the vessel, and
      when Captain Grant touched shore on the western coast of Australia on the
      8th of April 1852, he abandoned him there, which was only right.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So this wretch knew nothing about the wreck of the <i>Britannia</i>. He
      came to know of it from Glenarvan’s recital. Since his abandonment he had
      become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the chief of some escaped convicts,
      and if he impudently stated that the wreck had taken place on the eastern
      coast, if he could get Lord Glenarvan to go in this direction, it was
      because he hoped to separate him from his vessel, seize the <i>Duncan</i>
      and make this yacht a pirate ship in the Pacific.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled but he
      continued with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The expedition left and began to cross Australia. It was naturally full
      of misfortune, since Ayrton or Ben Joyce as we may call him, directed it,
      sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his band of convicts, who had
      been previously told what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      “However the <i>Duncan</i> had been sent to Melbourne for repairs. He
      tried to convince Lord Glenarvan to give him an order directing the
      <i>Duncan</i> to leave Melbourne to go to the eastern coast of Australia
      where it would be easy to seize it . After having led the expedition
      rather close to the coast, in the middle of vast forests where all
      resources were lacking, Ayrton obtained a letter which he was charged to
      carry to the second mate of the <i>Duncan</i>, a letter which gave the
      order for the yacht to proceed immediately to the eastern coast, to
      Twofold Bay, that is to say a few days travel from the place where the
      expedition had halted. It was there that Ayrton expected to rendez-vous
      with his accomplices.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just at the moment when the letter was about to be given to him, the
      traitor was unmasked and there was nothing he could do but flee. But this
      letter which would put the <i>Duncan</i> under his control, he had to
      have at all costs. Ayrton succeeded in getting it and two days later he
      arrived at Melbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Up to that point the criminal had succeeded in his odious project. If he
      could lead the <i>Duncan</i> to this Twofold Bay where it would be easy
      for the convicts to seize it and massacre its crew, Ben Joyce would
      become the master of the seas... God had to stop him from the
      accomplishment of these criminal designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton, arriving at Melbourne, gave the letter to the second, Tom
      Austin, who, obeying its instructions, got under weigh immediately; but
      judge the disappointment and rage of Ayrton when the day after weighing
      anchor, he found that the second was conducting the vessel not to the
      eastern coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but rather to the eastern
      coast of New Zealand! He objected. Austin showed him the letter!... And
      in fact, thanks to a providential error made by the French geographer who
      had drafted the letter, the eastern coast of New Zealand was indicated as
      the destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton’s plans had miscarried. He rebelled. They locked him up. He was
      taken to the coast of New Zealand not knowing what became of his
      accomplices nor what became of Lord Glenarvan.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Duncan</i> cruised along the coast until the 3rd of March. On
      that day Ayrton heard gunfire. It was the firing of the <i>Duncan</i>’s
      cannons and soon Lord Glenarvan and all with him came on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After a thousand exertions and a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had
      been able to complete his journey and arrive at the eastern coast of
      Australia at Twofold Bay. No <i>Duncan</i>. He telegraphed to Melbourne.
      They replied: ‘<i>Duncan</i> left on the 18th of this month for an
      unknown destination.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord Glenarvan could think of only one thing: that the honest yacht had
      fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce and that it had become a pirate
      vessel!
    </p>
    <p>
      “However Lord Glenarvan did not wish to abandon his undertaking. He was a
      dauntless and courageous man. He embarked on a merchant vessel which took
      him to the western coast of New Zealand and crossed it on the 37th
      parallel without finding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other
      coast, to his great surprise and by the will of Heaven, he again found
      the <i>Duncan</i> under the command of the second mate, waiting for him
      for five weeks!
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was the 3rd of March 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on board the
      <i>Duncan</i>, but Ayrton was also there. He was summoned to appear
      before the lord who wanted to extract from him all that the ruffian knew
      on the subject of Captain Grant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan
      told him that at the next port they would put him in the hands of English
      authorities. Ayrton remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Duncan</i> resumed its journey along the 37th parallel. However
      Lady Glenarvan undertook to overcome the ruffian’s resistance. Her
      influence finally swayed him and Ayrton, in exchange for what he could
      tell, proposed to Lord Glenarvan that they abandon him on one of the
      islets of the Pacific instead of delivering him to English authorities.
      Lord Glenarvan, deciding to learn all that he could concerning Captain
      Grant, consented to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton then related his entire life and he stated that he knew nothing
      from the day that Captain Grant had landed him on the Australian Coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless Lord Glenarvan kept his word. The <i>Duncan</i> continued
      on its way and arrived at Tabor Island. It was there that Ayrton would be
      deposed, and it was also there that, by a true miracle, they found
      Captain Grant and his two men, precisely on the 37th parallel. The
      convict was to take their place on this desert islet and just as he was
      leaving the yacht, Lord Glenarvan made this statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Here, Ayrton, you will be far from all land and without any possible
      communication with your fellow men. You will not be able to escape from
      this islet on which the <i>Duncan</i> leaves you. You will be alone,
      under the eye of God, who reads into the depths of the heart, but you
      will neither be lost nor ignored as was Captain Grant. However unworthy
      you are to be remembered by men, men will remember you. I know where you
      are, Ayrton, and I know where to find you. I will never forget it!’
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the <i>Duncan</i>, getting underway, soon disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This was on the 18th of March 1855.<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton was alone but he lacked neither munitions, nor weapons, nor
      tools, nor seed. The convict had available to him the house constructed
      by the honest Captain Grant. It only remained for him to expiate in
      seclusion the crimes that he had committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and he suffered. He
      told himself that if one day men would find him on the islet, he must be
      worthy to return among them. How the wretch suffered! How he labored to
      redeem himself through work! How he begged for redemption through prayer!
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so it was for two or three years; but Ayrton, harassed by isolation,
      always looked to see if some vessel was in sight on the horizon. He asked
      himself if his period of expiation would soon be over. He suffered as he
      had never suffered. Ah! solitude was difficult for a soul undermined by
      remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But doubtless Heaven did not find him sufficiently punished. Little by
      little the wretch felt himself becoming a savage. Little by little he
      felt brutishness overcoming him. He could not say if it was after two or
      four years of abandonment, but finally he became the beast that you
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce and I are
      the same person.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions got up at the end of this recital. It was
      difficult to say at what point they had become affected. Such misery,
      such suffering and despair, exposed and bared to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ayrton,” Cyrus Smith then said, “you have been a hardened criminal but
      Heaven must certainly find that you have expiated your crimes. It has
      proved it by returning you to your fellow men. Ayrton, you are pardoned!
      And now will you be our companion?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here is my hand,” said the engineer.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>“Here is my hand,” said the engineer.</b>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Ayrton rushed toward the hand that Cyrus Smith offered him and large
      tears flowed from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you want to live with us?” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Smith, let me be still some time,” replied Ayrton, “let me be
      alone in the hut at the corral”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you wish, Ayrton,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton was about to leave when the engineer addressed one last question
      to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Still another word, my friend. Since your intention was to live in
      isolation, why did you throw into the sea this document which put us on
      your trail?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A document?” replied Ayrton, who did not appear to understand what they
      were talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, this document enclosed in a bottle which we found, which gave the
      exact position of Tabor Island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton passed his hand over his forehead. Then after having thought about
      it:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never threw any document into the sea!” he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never?” cried Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton bowed, went to the door, and left.
    </p>
