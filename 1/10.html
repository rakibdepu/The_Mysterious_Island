      <b class="cap">Several</b> moments later the three hunters found
      themselves in front of a crackling hearth. Cyrus Smith and the reporter
      were there. Pencroff looked from one to the other without saying a word,
      his capybara in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes indeed, my good fellow,” cried the reporter. “Fire, real fire, that
      will perfectly roast this magnificent game which we will feast on within
      the hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But who kindled it?...” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The sun!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett’s response was precise. It was the sun which had furnished
      the heat that had astonished Pencroff. The sailor could not believe his
      eyes and he was so amazed that he did not think of questioning the
      engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You had a lens, sir?” Herbert asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my child,” he replied, “but I made one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And he showed the apparatus that had served him as a lens. It was simply
      two glasses that he had lifted from the watch of the reporter and of his
      own. After having filled them with water and made their edges adherent by
      means of a little clay, he had thus fabricated a real lens which,
      concentrating the sun’s rays on some very dry moss, produced combustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor examined the apparatus, then he looked at the engineer without
      saying a word except that his look spoke volumes. Yes, as far as he was
      concerned, if Cyrus Smith was not a god, he was assuredly more than a
      mere man. Finally speech returned and he shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Note that, Mister Spilett, note that in your book!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is noted,” replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with Neb helping, the sailor arranged the spit, and the capybara,
      properly dressed, was soon roasting like a simple suckling pig before a
      bright and sparkling flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chimneys once more became habitable, not only because the corridors
      were warmed by the fire from the hearth but because the partitions of
      stones and sand were re-established.
    </p>
    <p>
      One could see that the engineer and his companion had employed their day
      well. Cyrus Smith had almost completely recovered his strength which he
      tested by climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye,
      accustomed to evaluate heights and distances, gazed for a while on this
      cone whose summit he wanted to reach on the next day. The mountain,
      situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to measure
      three thousand five hundred feet above sea level. Consequently, the gaze
      of an observer posted at the summit would cover a radius of at least
      fifty miles. It was therefore probable that Cyrus Smith would easily
      resolve the question “continent or island” which he justifiably gave
      precedence over all other questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They supped in style. The cabybara meat was excellent. The seaweed and
      the pine kernel almonds completed the meal during which the engineer
      spoke little. He was preoccupied with the projects of the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice Pencroff put forth some ideas about things it would be
      convenient to make, but Cyrus Smith, who evidently had a methodical mind,
      was content to shake his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tomorrow,” he repeated, “we will know what we have to contend with and
      we will act accordingly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal completed, some additional armfuls of wood were thrown on the
      fire and the hosts of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, fell into
      a deep sleep. No incident disturbed this peaceful night and the next day,
      March 29th, fresh and hearty, they woke up ready to undertake this
      excursion which would fix their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was ready for the departure. The remains of the capybara would
      provide nourishment for Cyrus Smith and his companions for the next
      twenty four hours. Besides they hoped to revictual en route. Since the
      glasses were put back on the engineer’s and the reporter’s watches,
      Pencroff burnt a little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint, there
      would be no shortage of that on terrain that was of plutonic origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was seven thirty in the morning when the explorers, armed with clubs,
      left the Chimneys. Following Pencroff’s advice it seemed best to take the
      road already used through the forest and to use another route on the
      return trip. It was also the most direct way to reach the mountain. They
      therefore turned the south corner and followed the left bank of the river
      which was abandoned at the point where it curved toward the southwest.
      The footpath, already frayed under the green trees, was found and at nine
      o’clock Cyrus Smith and his companions reached the western edge of the
      forest. The ground, which was not too hilly up to that point, marshy at
      first, dry and sandy later, betrayed a slight incline as one went from
      the coast to the interior. Several fleeing animals had been indistinctly
      seen in the forest. Top briskly cut them off, but his master recalled him
      at once because the time had not come to pursue them. Later they would
      see. The engineer was not a man to let himself be distracted from his
      intent. One would not even be mistaken in affirming that he did not
      observe the country, neither its configuration nor its natural
      productions. His only objective was this mountain which he aspired to
      climb and he went straight to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o’clock they halted for a few minutes. On leaving the forest the
      mountain system of the country appeared before their eyes. The mountain
      was composed of two cones. The first, truncated at a height of
      approximately two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by capricious
      spurs which seemed to spread out like immense claws gripping the ground.
      Between these spurs were narrow valleys, bristling with trees, the latter
      rising in clusters up to the truncation of the first cone. However, the
      vegetation seemed less abundant on the side of the mountain exposed to
      the northeast and they could see there the rather deep stripes made by
      flowing lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second cone rested on the first cone, slightly rounded at the top,
      standing a bit askew. One could call it a large hat placed over an ear.
      It seemed to be formed of bare terrain with many reddish rocks showing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the summit of the second cone that they agreed to reach and the
      ridge of the spurs offered the best way to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are on volcanic terrain,” Cyrus Smith said, and his companions,
      following him, began to climb little by little up the back of a spur
      which, by a winding path and consequently an easier pathway, ended at the
      first plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many swellings on the ground evidently made by plutonic
      convulsion. Erratic blocks, basaltic debris, pumice rocks and volcanic
      glass were all about. Several hundred feet below grew these conifers, in
      thick isolated clusters, at the bottom of narrow gorges scarcely reached
      by the sun’s rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first part of this ascension on the lower ramps, Herbert noted
      prints which indicated the recent passage of large animals, wild or
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps these beasts will not be willing to relinquish their domain to
      us,” said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in India
      and the lion in Africa, “we will see about getting rid of them but in the
      meantime let us be careful.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They gradually went higher. The route was long because it was lengthened
      by detours and obstacles that they could not cross directly. Also at
      times the ground was suddenly hollow and they found themselves at the
      edge of deep crevices that they had to go round. They thus had to retrace
      their steps in order to follow some practical path, which took time and
      energy. At noon, when the small troupe halted for lunch at the foot of a
      large cluster of spruce trees near a brook that fell in a cascade, they
      found themselves still only half way to the first plateau, which they
      would not reach till nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this height the sea’s horizon was very enlarged, but on the right the
      view was interrupted by a sharp promontory in the southeast and they
      could not determine whether the coastline was abruptly connected to some
      rear terrain. At the left the line of sight extended several miles to the
      north; nevertheless from the northwest, at the point occupied by the
      explorers, it was interrupted by a ridge of a bizarre buttress formed
      from the powerful abutment of the central cone. Hence they still could
      not answer the question that Cyrus Smith wanted to resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o’clock the climb was resumed. It was necessary to shift to the
      southwest and once again move through rather thick brushwood. There under
      the cover of the trees, flew several couples of gallinules of the
      pheasant family. They were “tragopans” adorned by fleshy wattles which
      hang from their throats and by two slender cylindrical horns set behind
      their eyes. Among these couples, which are the size of a rooster, the
      female is uniformly brown while the male glitters in his red plummage
      sprinkled with small white teardrop shapes. Gideon Spilett with a stone
      thrown skillfully and vigorously, killed one of these tragopans that
      Pencroff, famished by the open air, could not look at without some
      covetousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon leaving the brushwood the climbers pushed each other leg up,
      struggling on a very steep hundred foot slope to reach a higher level
      composed of volcanic ground with few trees. They then went toward the
      east once more moving on a winding path which made the very steep slopes
      more practical. Everyone had to carefully choose the spot where he placed
      his foot. Neb and Herbert were in front, Pencroff was in the rear and
      Cyrus and the reporter were between them. The animals which frequented
      these heights—and there was no lack of their traces—necessarily belonged
      to those species of sure foot and supple backbone, the chamois and the
      izards. They saw several of them but this was not the name that Pencroff
      gave them because in a moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sheep!” he shouted.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="../pics/121.jpg" border="1" width="328" height="469" alt=
        "" /><br />
        <b>The climbers pushed each other leg up...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Everyone stopped fifty feet from a half dozen of these large animals with
      strong horns curving rearward and flat at the tip and with woolen fleece
      hidden under long silky buff colored hair. They were not ordinary sheep
      but a species generally found in the mountainous regions of the temperate
      zones which Herbert gave the name of mouflons.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do they have legs and chops?” asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then they are sheep,” said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      These animals stood still among the basaltic debris looking astonished as
      if they saw biped humans for the first time. Then their fear suddenly
      awakened and they disappeared in a bound among the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Au revoir,” Pencroff shouted in a tone so comic that Cyrus Smith, Gideon
      Spilett, Herbert and Neb could not refrain from laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The climb continued. They frequently noted, on certain declivities,
      traces of very capriciously scored lava. They had to go around small
      volcanic areas of hot sulphur vapors which sometimes cut across the route
      followed by the climbers. In several places sulphur was present in
      crystalline form, among material that was generally there before the lava
      flows, material such as pozzuolanas in irregular pellets, and highly
      torrefied white cinders made by an infinity of small feldspar crystals.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the approaches to the first plateau, formed by the truncation of the
      lower cone, the difficulties of climbing were very pronounced. Around
      four o’clock the last zone of trees had been passed. There only remained,
      here and there, some emaciated pines which had a hard life in resisting
      the strong open winds at this height. Fortunately for the engineer and
      his companions, the weather was magnificent and the atmosphere tranquil
      because a strong breeze at an altitude of three thousand feet would have
      affected their balance. The purity of the sky at the zenith was felt
      through the transparent air. Perfect calm reigned around them. They could
      no longer see the sun, then covered by the vast shade of the upper cone,
      which masked the western horizon. This enormous shadow, reaching to the
      shore, would lengthen as the radiant luminary went lower in it daily
      course. Several wisps of haze rather than clouds began to rise in the
      east colored by all the colors of the spectrum under the action of the
      solar rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only five hundred feet then separated the explorers from the plateau that
      they wished to attain in order to establish camp for the night but these
      five hundred feet were increased to more than two thousand by the zigzags
      that they had to follow. The ground, as has been said, was hollow
      underfoot. The slope was so steep that they slipped on the lava when the
      ridges, worn by the wind, did not offer sufficient support. Evening came
      on little by little and it was almost night when Cyrus Smith and his
      companions, very tired from a climb of seven hours, reached the plateau
      of the first cone. It was then a question of organizing a camp and of
      recuperating by eating first and sleeping afterwards. The second stage of
      the mountain rose on a base of rocks among which they would easily find a
      retreat. Fuel was not abundant. However they could obtain fire by means
      of moss and dry brushwood which grew on certain portions of the plateau.
      While the sailor made his fireplace on rocks which he arranged for this
      purpose, Neb and Herbert occupied themselves with gathering fuel. They
      soon returned with a load of brushwood. The flint was struck, the burnt
      linen caught the sparks of the flint and with Neb blowing, a crackling
      fire developed in a few moments sheltered by the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was only intended to withstand the temperature which was a
      little cold for the night. It was not used to roast the pheasant which
      Neb saved for the next day. The rest of the capybara and a few dozen
      almonds of the pine kernel formed the elements of supper. It was not more
      than six thirty when everything was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith then thought of exploring, in the semi-obscurity, this large
      circular foundation which supported the upper cone of the mountain.
      Before taking some rest he wanted to know if this cone could be turned at
      its base because if its flanks were too steep it would render the summit
      inaccessible. This question did not cease to preoccupy him because it was
      possible that on the side toward which the hat inclined, that is to say
      toward the north, the plateau was not practical. Now, on the one hand, if
      they could not reach the summit of the mountain, and if on the other hand
      they could not go round the base of the cone then it would be impossible
      to examine the western portion of the country and the purpose of the
      climb would be in part unfulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the engineer, without taking account of his fatigue, leaving
      Pencroff and Neb to organize the sleeping arrangements and Gideon Spilett
      to note the incidents of the day, began to follow the circular border of
      the plateau going northward. Herbert accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was fine and tranquil and not yet fully dark. Cyrus Smith and
      the lad walked near each other without speaking. In certain places the
      plateau was wide and they passed without difficulty. Other places,
      obstructed by debris, offered only a narrow path such that two people
      could not walk abreast. After a march of twenty minutes Cyrus Smith and
      Herbert had to stop. From this point on the slopes of the two cones were
      flush. No shoulder separated the two parts of the mountain. A slope of
      nearly 70° made it impractical.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the engineer and the lad had to turn away from following a
      circular route, in compensation there was the possibility that they could
      ascend the cone directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact there was before them a deep opening in the solid block. It was
      the flare of the upper crater, the outlet so to speak, by which liquid
      eruptive material escaped at a time when the volcano was still active.
      The hardened lava and the encrusted slag formed a sort of natural
      staircase well designed for a climb, which would facilitate access to the
      summit of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance sufficed for Cyrus Smith to recognize the situation and without
      hesitating and followed by the lad he entered the enormous crevice in the
      midst of the growing darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still a height of a thousand feet to climb. Would the inclines
      of the interior of the crater be practical? They would see. The engineer
      would continue his climb as long as he could. Fortunately the incline was
      gradual and winding, describing a large helical path along the interior
      of the volcano and favoring the upward march.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the volcano itself, there was no doubt that it was completely
      extinct. No smoke escaped from its bowels. No flame revealed itself in
      the deep cavities. Not a growl, nor a murmur, nor a disturbance left its
      obscure pits which perhaps extended to the bowels of the earth. Even the
      atmosphere within the crater was not saturated with any sulphurous vapor.
      It was not merely the slumber of a volcano. It was its complete
      extinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith’s attempt would succeed. Little by little Herbert and he,
      ascending the inner walls, saw the crater enlarge above their heads. The
      radius of this circular portion of the sky, surrounded by the borders of
      the cone, was getting noticeably larger. With each step, so to speak,
      that Cyrus Smith and Herbert made, new stars were entering their field of
      view. The magnificent constellations of the southern sky were shining
      brightly. At zenith the splendid Antares of Scorpio was sparkling with a
      pure glare and not far away was the β of Centaurus which is thought to be
      the nearest star to the terrestial globe. Then as they went higher,
      Fomalhaut of the Southern Fish appeared, the Southern Triangle and
      finally near the southern pole of the sky, the sparkling Southern Cross
      which takes the place of the pole star of the northern hemisphere.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>As they went higher...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It was nearly eight o’clock when Cyrus Smith and Herbert set foot on the
      upper crest of the mountain, the summit of the cone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then completely dark and they could not see for more than two
      miles. Did the sea completely surround this unknown land or was this land
      attached in the west to some continent of the Pacific? They still could
      not tell. Toward the west clouds were clearly delineated by the horizon
      adding to the darkness and the eye could not distinguish the confusion of
      the sky and water on this circular line.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at one point of this horizon a vague light suddenly appeared slowly
      descending as the clouds rose to the zenith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the slender crescent of the moon about to set. But its light was
      sufficient to clearly show the horizon then detached from a cloud and the
      engineer was able to see its trembling image reflected for a moment on
      the liquid surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith seized the lad’s hand and in a solemn voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “An island!” he said at the moment when the light of the lunar crescent
      was extinguished by the waves.
