    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">The</b> colonists of Lincoln Island cast one last glance
      around them, they went around the crater by its narrow ridge and a half
      hour later they had climbed down to the first plateau to their night
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff thought that it was mealtime and for this purpose he raised the
      question of adjusting the two watches belonging to Cyrus Smith and the
      reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that Gideon Spilett’s watch had been respected by the sea water
      since the reporter had been thrown on the beach from the first, out of
      the reach of the waves. It was an instrument kept in excellent condition,
      a real pocket chronometer which Gideon Spilett had never forgotten to
      wind carefully each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the engineer’s watch, it had necessarily stopped during the time
      that Cyrus Smith had passed on the dunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer reset it, estimating approximately from the height of the
      sun that it was about nine o’clock in the morning. He set his watch to
      this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett was about to imitate him when the engineer held him back
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the time of Richmond, haven’t
      you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Cyrus.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Consequently your watch is set to the meridian of that city, a meridian
      which is very nearly that of Washington?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No doubt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well, then keep the setting. Remain content to wind it carefully
      but do not touch the hands. This will be useful to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What good will that be?” thought the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ate so well that the supply of game and almonds was completely
      exhausted. But Pencroff was not uneasy. They would reprovision en route.
      Top, whose portion was very meager, would well know how to find some new
      game under the cover of the brushwood. Later the sailor intended to ask
      the engineer in all innocence to make powder and one or two hunting guns
      and he thought that this would present no difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the plateau Cyrus Smith proposed to his companions that they
      take a new road to return to the Chimneys. He wanted to explore Lake
      Grant which was so magnificently surrounded by a border of trees. They
      followed the crest of one of the buttresses where the creek <sup><a href=
      "#n1">1</a></sup> that fed the lake probably found its source. While
      chatting, the colonists were already using the proper names that they had
      chosen and this singularly facilitated the exchange of ideas. Herbert and
      Pencroff—the one young and the other like a small child—were enchanted
      and while walking the sailor said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hey, Herbert, how things are coming along! We can’t possibly get lost,
      my boy, since whether we follow the road to Lake Grant or we rejoin the
      Mercy by crossing the woods of the Far West we will necessarily arrive at
      Grand View Plateau and consequently at Union Bay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been agreed that, without forming a compact group, the colonists
      would not wander far from each other. Very certainly some dangerous
      animals inhabited the thick forests of the island and it would be prudent
      to be on their guard. As a rule, Pencroff, Herbert and Neb went on ahead,
      preceded by Top who nuzzled into the slightest corner. The reporter and
      the engineer went together. Gideon Spilett was ready to record every
      incident. The engineer was silent most of the time, wandering from the
      road only to pick up sometimes one, sometimes another mineral or
      vegetable substance which he put in his pocket without making any
      comment.
    </p>

        <b>Pencroff went on ahead, preceded by Top.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “What the devil can he be picking up?” murmured Pencroff. “I have looked
      carefully and I don’t see anything worth bending over for.”
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o’clock the small troop descended the last slopes of Mount
      Franklin. The soil was still scattered with only bushes and some sparse
      trees. They walked on yellowish calcinated ground forming a plain about a
      mile long which preceded the border of the woods. Some large sections of
      basalt which, according to Bischof, require three hundred fifty million
      years to cool, were strewn on the plain, very broken up in places.
      However there were no traces of lava which had especially poured out on
      the northern slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith believed that he could reach the creek’s course without
      incident which, according to him, would unfold under the trees at the
      edge of the plain, when he came headlong into Herbert, while Neb and the
      sailor were hiding behind some rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it, my boy?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A smoke,” replied Herbert. “We have seen a smoke rising among the rocks
      about a hundred feet from us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Men in this area?” cried the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us avoid showing ourselves before we know with whom we are dealing,”
      replied Cyrus Smith. “I especially fear the natives if there are any of
      them on this island, which I do not wish for. Where is Top?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Top is up in front.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And he does not bark?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s strange. Nevertheless, let us try to recall him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the engineer, Gideon Spilett and Herbert had rejoined
      their two companions and like them they hid behind some basalt debris.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there they could clearly see a smoke with a characteristic yellow
      color twirling into the air.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="../pics/149.jpg" border="1" width="326" height="457" alt=

        <b>From there they could see a smoke...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Top was recalled by a weak whistle from his master who, making a sign to
      his companions to wait for him, glided among the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were immobile, waiting for the result of this exploration
      with a certain anxiety when a call from Cyrus Smith made them run up.
      They soon rejoined him and were all at once struck by a disagreeable odor
      which impregnated the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      This easily recognized odor had sufficed for the engineer to guess at the
      identity of this smoke which at first had caused the anxiety, not without
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This fire,” he said, “or rather this smoke is due only to nature’s
      efforts. It is due to a sulphuric spring which will permit us to
      effectively treat our laryngites.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good,” cried Pencroff. “What a pity that I don’t have a cold.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists went to the spot where the smoke escaped. There they saw a
      sulphuric salt spring pouring out rather abundantly among the rocks. The
      water gave off a vivid sulphuric acid odor after having absorbed the
      oxygen from the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith dipped his hand into it, finding these waters oily to the
      touch. He tasted it and found it to be a little sweet. As to its
      temperature he estimated it to be at 95° Fahrenheit (35° Centigrade above
      zero). And Herbert having asked him on what he based this evaluation:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very simple, my child,” he said, “because on plunging my hand into this
      water I felt no sensation of either hot or cold. Thus, it is the same
      temperature as the human body which is about 95°.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the sulphuric spring was of no actual benefit, the colonists went
      toward the thick border of the forest which grew a few hundred feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, as they had guessed, the brisk clear waters of the stream ran
      between the high banks of red ground whose color revealed the presence of
      iron oxide. This color immediately gave to this watercourse the name of
      Red Creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a large brook, deep and clear, formed by the waters of the
      mountain which half stream, half torrent, flowed peacefully here on a
      sand bed, rumbling over the tops of the rocks on which they fell in a
      cascade. It flowed toward the lake a mile and a half away, over a width
      varying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet which led them
      to believe that so also were the waters of the lake. This would be a
      happy circumstance in the event they should find a dwelling on its border
      more agreeable than the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the trees which shaded the banks of the creek a hundred feet
      downstream, they appeared for the most part to be of a species which are
      abundant in the temperate zone of Australia and of Tasmania and not those
      of the conifers which grew on that part of the island already explored a
      few miles from Grand View Plateau. At this time of the year, at the
      beginning of the month of April, which corresponds to the month of
      October in the northern hemisphere, that is to say at the start of
      autumn, the foliage is not yet missing. This was especially so with the
      casuarinas and the eucalyptus some of which would furnish next spring a
      sweet manna perfectly analogous to the manna of the orient. Some clusters
      of Australian cedars also grew in the clearings which were covered with a
      tall grass called “tussock” in Australia. However, the coconut which is
      so abundant in the archipelagos of the Pacific seemed to be missing on
      the island whose latitude was doubtless too low.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a pity” said Herbert, “a tree which is so useful and which has such
      beautiful nuts.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the birds, they swarmed among the somewhat lean branches of the
      eucalyptus and the casuarinas which did not hide their wing displays.
      Black, white or grey cockatoos, parrots and parakeets with a plumage
      tinged with all colors, “kings” with a bright green crowned with red,
      blue loris and “blue mountains” gave a sight like looking through a
      prism. They flew amid a deafening clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once a strange concert of discordant voices resounded from the
      midst of a thicket. The colonists heard successively the singing of
      birds, the cries of quadrupeds and a sort of clapping which they would
      have believed escaped from the lips of a native. Neb and Herbert ran
      toward this bush forgetting the most elementary principles of prudence.
      Very fortunately there was no formidable beast there nor a dangerous
      native but very simply a half dozen of these mocking and singing birds
      which they recognized as “mountain pheasants.” A few strokes of the
      stick, skillfully applied, terminated this scene of mimicking and also
      procured excellent game for the evening meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert also pointed out some magnificent pigeons with bronze colored
      wings, some topped by a superb crest, others draped in green like their
      congeners from Port Macquarie; but it was impossible to catch them any
      more than the crows and magpies which flew away in flocks. A firing of
      small shot would have produced a great slaughter among these birds, but
      the hunters were still limited to stones for missiles and to sticks for
      hand held weapons and these primitive devices could not be anything but
      very inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their inadequacy was demonstrated more clearly again when a troop of
      hopping and bounding quadrupedes, making leaps of thirty feet, real
      flying mammals, ran away over the thicket so nimbly and at such a height
      that they seemed to pass from one tree to another like squirrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Kangaroos!” shouted Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And are they edible?” replied Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stewed,” responded the reporter, “they compare to a better venison!...”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting statement when the sailor,
      followed by Neb and Herbert, went after the kangaroos. Cyrus Smith called
      them back but in vain. But it was also in vain that the hunters ran after
      this springy game which bounced like a ball. After five minutes of
      running they were out of breath and the band disappeared in the
      brushwood. Top had had no more success than his masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Cyrus,” said Pencroff when they rejoined the engineer and the
      reporter, “Mister Cyrus, you can well see that it is indispensable to
      make some guns. Will that be possible?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps,” replied the engineer, “but we will first begin by making some
      bows and arrows and I do not doubt that you will become just as skilled
      in their use as the Australian hunters.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Arrows, bows!” said Pencroff with a condescending pout. “That’s very
      well for children!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t be proud, friend Pencroff,” responded the reporter. “Bows and
      arrows sufficed for centuries to stain the earth with blood. Powder is
      only a thing of yesterday but war is as old as the human race
      unfortunately.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must excuse me, Mister Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I always speak
      too quickly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert however, engrossed in his favorite science of natural history,
      returned to the subject of the kangaroos by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides, we had an encounter there with a species that is most difficult
      to capture. They were giants with a long grey fur but if I am not
      mistaken there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos and rat
      kangaroos which are much easier to lay hands on. One can count a dozen
      species...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Herbert” replied the sailor dogmatically, “for me there is only one
      species of kangaroo, the ‘kangaroo-on-the-spit’, and that is precisely
      the one that we will not have this evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not help laughing on hearing this new classification by Master
      Pencroff. The good sailor could not at all hide his regret at being
      reduced to a dinner of singing pheasants, but fortune would show itself
      once more to accommodate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top in fact, took a strong interest in the hunt, nosing about everywhere
      with an instinct increased by a ferocious appetite. It was even likely
      that if some game came under his control nothing would be left to the
      hunters and that Top was then hunting for himself, but Neb did well to
      watch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o’clock the dog disappeared into the brushwood and some
      muffled growlings soon indicated that he was at grips with some animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb dashed forward and sure enough he found Top greedily devouring a
      quadrupede which, ten seconds later, would have been impossible to
      recognize in Top’s stomach. But very fortunately the dog fell upon a
      brood; he had killed three. Two other rodents—the animals in question
      appeared to be of this order—were lying strangled on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb reappeared triumphant holding one of these rodents in each hand whose
      size exceeded that of a hare. Their yellow fur was mixed with greenish
      spots and their tail existed only in a rudimentary state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The citizens of the Union did not hesitate to give these rodents the name
      which befitted them. They were “maras,” a sort of agouti, a little larger
      than their congeners from the tropical countries, really American
      rabbits, with long ears and with five molars on each side of the jaws,
      which is the distinguishing characteristic of agoutis.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah!” cried Pencroff. “The roast has arrived and now we can go home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The march, momentarily interrupted, was resumed. The clear water of Red
      Creek rambled on under a canopy of casuarinas, banksias and gigantic gum
      trees. Superb liliaceous plants grew to a height of twenty feet. Other
      species of trees, which were unknown to the young naturalist, inclined
      over the brook which they heard murmuring under these arches of foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      However the watercourse was becoming noticeably wider and Cyrus Smith was
      led to believe that it would soon reach its mouth. In fact, upon leaving
      a thick mass of beautiful trees it suddenly appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. This area
      was worth looking at. This expanse of water with a circumference of about
      seven miles and with an area of two hundred fifty acres <sup><a href=
      "#n2">2</a></sup> was set within a border of various trees. Toward the
      east, across a screen of foliage picturesquely enhanced in some places,
      appeared the sparkling horizon of the sea. In the north, the lake traced
      a slightly concave curve which contrasted with the sharp outline of is
      lower point. Numerous aquatic birds frequented the banks of this small
      Ontario. The “Thousand Islands” of its American namesake were represented
      by a rock which emerged above the surface at several hundred feet from
      the southern bank. There, several couples of kingfishers lived together,
      perched on some stone, solemn, immobile, on the lookout for passing fish.
      Then rushing and plunging with a sharp cry, they reappeared with prey in
      their beak. Elsewhere on the banks and on the islet there strutted wild
      ducks, pelicans, waterfowl, redbeaks, philedons provided with a tongue in
      the form of a paintbrush, and one or two specimens of those splendid
      lyrebirds whose tail unfolds like the gracious motion of a harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the waters of the lake, they were sweet and clear. From certain
      bubblings in concentric circles which intersected at their surface they
      could not doubt but that it abounded in fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This lake is truly beautiful,” said Gideon Spilett. “We could live on
      its shore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will live there!” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, then wanting to return to the Chimneys by the shortest
      way, went toward the angle formed in the south by the junction of the
      banks of the lake. With some difficulty they cut a path through the
      thickets and brushwood on which the hand of man had never made its mark
      and so they went toward the shore, arriving at the north of Grand View
      Plateau. Two miles were crossed in this direction when, after a last
      screen of trees, the plateau appeared, covered with a thick turf, and
      beyond that, the infinite sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to return to the Chimneys it would have been sufficient to cross
      the plateau obliquely for a distance of a mile and to descend to the bend
      formed by the first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer wanted to find
      out how and where the overflow of water escaped from the lake and the
      exploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half toward
      the north. In fact it was probable that an outlet existed which doubtless
      went through a cut in the granite. In sum, the lake was only an immense
      basin which was gradually replenished by the flow from the creek and it
      could well be that the overflow escaped to the sea by some falls. If such
      was the case, the engineer thought that it would perhaps be possible to
      utilize this fall and to make use of its force, actually lost without
      profit to anyone. They continued thus to follow the banks of Lake Grant
      along the plateau; but after going another mile in this direction Cyrus
      Smith had not been able to discover the outlet which must exist however.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then half past four. The preparations for dinner required that the
      colonists go back to their dwelling. The small troop then retraced its
      steps along the left bank of the Mercy and Cyrus Smith and his companions
      arrived at the Chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the fire was lit and Neb and Pencroff, on whom naturally devolved
      the duties of chefs, the one by virtue of being a Negro, the other by
      virtue of being a sailor, skillfully prepared grilled agoutis to which
      they did justice.

    <p>
      The meal completed, the time came for everyone to get ready for bed.
      Cyrus Smith took some small samples of different minerals from his pocket
      and contented himself with saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friends, here is iron ore, here is pyrites, here is clay, here is
      lime, and here is coal. This is what nature gives us as its contributions
      to our efforts. Tomorrow we will do our share.”
