    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">It</b> was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the
      6th of November in the countries of the northern hemisphere. The sky had
      been overcast for several days and it was important to make certain
      arrangements with a view to wintering. Nevertheless the temperature was
      not yet sensibly lower and a centigrade thermometer transported to
      Lincoln Island would still have marked an average of ten to twelve
      degrees above zero. This average is not surprising since Lincoln Island,
      very definitely situated between the 35th and 40th parallel, must find
      itself subject, in the southern hemisphere, to the same climatic
      conditions as Sicily or Greece in the northern hemisphere. But, like
      Greece or Sicily which suffer intensive frosts that produce snow and ice,
      Lincoln Island too would be subject doubtless, in the more pronounced
      periods of winter, to certain low temperatures against which it would be
      best to protect themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, if the frost did not yet menace them, the rainy season was
      approaching and on this isolated island, exposed to all the inclemencies
      of the vast Pacific Ocean, the bad weather would be frequent and probably
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of a dwelling more comfortable than the Chimneys therefore
      had to be seriously considered and promptly resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff naturally had some partiality for this retreat which he had
      discovered, but he well understood that it was necessary to look for
      another. Already the Chimneys had been visited by the sea under
      circumstances that we recall, and they could not expose themselves to a
      similar accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides,” added Cyrus Smith, who on this day spoke of these things with
      his companions, “we have several precautions to take.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why? The island is not inhabited,” said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is probable,” replied the engineer, “although we have not yet
      explored it in its entirety, but if no human being is found, I fear that
      dangerous animals abound. It would thus be best to shelter ourselves
      against a possible aggression, and don’t forget that one of us must stay
      awake each night to keep up the fire. And thus, my friends, we must
      anticipate everything. We are here in a part of the Pacific that is often
      frequented by Malay pirates...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What,” said Herbert, “at this distance from all land?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my child,” replied the engineer. “These pirates are hardy sailors
      as well as formidable scoundrels and we will have to take measures in
      consequence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh well,” replied Pencroff, “we will fortify ourselves against savages
      with two feet as well as four feet. But, Mister Cyrus, shouldn’t we
      explore all parts of the island before undertaking anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That would be best,” added Gideon Spilett. “Who knows if we will not
      find on the opposite shore one of those caverns that we are vainly
      looking for here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is true,” replied the engineer, “but you forget, my friends, that
      it would be best to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a
      watercourse, and that from the summit of Mount Franklin we saw neither
      brook nor river toward the west. Here, on the contrary, we are situated
      between the Mercy and Lake Grant, a considerable advantage that we should
      not neglect. And moreover, this coast, oriented to the east, is not
      exposed as the other one is to the trade winds which blow from the
      northwest in this hemisphere.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor, “we will build a house on the
      borders of the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are lacking to us now.
      After having been brickmakers, potters, founders and blacksmiths, we will
      well know how to be masons, the devil!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my friend, but before making a decision we should go looking. A
      dwelling made at nature’s expense would save us a lot of work and would
      doubtless offer us a surer retreat because it could be better defended
      against enemies from inside as well as those from outside.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quite so, Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “but we have already examined
      all of this massive granite on the coast and there is not a hole, not
      even a crack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, not one” added Pencroff. “Ah! If we could excavate a dwelling in
      this wall at a certain height in a way that puts us out of reach, how
      convenient that would be. I see it now, a facade that overlooks the sea,
      five or six rooms...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “With windows to light them,” said Herbert laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And a staircase to climb to it,” added Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You laugh,” cried the sailor, “and why? Is what I propose impossible?
      Don’t we have the picks and pickaxes? Doesn’t Mister Cyrus know how to
      make the powder to explode a mine. Isn’t it true, Mister Cyrus, that you
      could make the powder for the day when we would need it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith listened as the enthusiastic Pencroff developed his somewhat
      fantastic projects. To attack this mass of granite, even with a mine, was
      a herculean task, and it was unfortunately true that nature had not made
      a harder task. But the engineer only replied to the sailor by proposing
      to examine more carefully the wall from the mouth of the river up to the
      corner which terminated it in the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then left and the exploration was made with extreme care over an
      extent of about two miles. But in no place could they see any cavity
      whatsoever in this wall which was smooth and straight. The nests of the
      rock pigeons which flew at its peak were in reality only holes bored in
      the crest itself and on the irregular edge cut from the granite.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unfortunate circumstance and as to attacking this mass be it
      with a pick or with powder in order to make a sufficient excavation, they
      could not think of it. It was quite by chance that on this entire coast,
      Pencroff had discovered the only provisionally habitable shelter, that is
      to say the Chimneys, which they were nevertheless proceeding to abandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exploration ended, the colonists then found themselves at the
      northern corner of the wall, where it terminated with elongated slopes
      that died out on the beach. From this neighborhood up to its extreme
      limit in the west, it formed only a sort of bank, a thick conglomeration
      of stones, soil and sand, bound together with plants, shrubs and grass
      inclined to an angle of forty five degrees. Here and there the granite
      still pierced through and stood out by sharp points from this sort of
      cliff. Clusters of trees spread out on its slopes and a rather thick
      grass carpeted it. But the vegetative effort did not go further and a
      long plain of sand, which began at the foot of the slope, extended up to
      the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith thought, not without reason, that there had to be an overflow
      of the lake on this side that would pour over in the form of a cascade.
      In fact it was necessary that the excess of water furnished by Red Creek
      should lose itself at some point. Now this point the engineer had not yet
      found at any portion of the shore already explored, that is to say from
      the mouth of the stream in the west up to Grand View Plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer then proposed to his companions that they climb the slope
      now in view and return to the Chimneys by the heights thereby exploring
      the northern and western banks of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposition was accepted and in several minutes Herbert and Neb had
      arrived at the upper plateau. Cyrus Smith, Gideon Spilett and Pencroff
      followed them more sedately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred feet away, past the foliage, the beautiful sheet of water
      shone under the rays of the sun. The landscape in this neighborhood was
      charming. The trees, turning yellow, were wonderfully grouped as a feast
      for the eyes. Several large old trunks, battered by age, stood out by
      their blackish bark on the green carpet which covered the soil. A whole
      world of noisy cockatoos chattered away, veritable mobile prisms, who
      jumped from one branch to the next. One could say that light arrived only
      decomposed across this singular foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, instead of going directly to the north shore of the lake,
      went around the edge of the plateau so as to reach the mouth of the creek
      on its left bank. It was a detour of a mile and a half at most. It was an
      easy walk because the widely spaced trees allowed an easy passage. They
      sensed that this was the limit of the fertile zone and the vegetation
      showed itself less vigorous here than in the entire area between the
      creek and the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions did not walk on this unknown soil without
      a certain caution. Bows, arrows, and sticks fitted with an iron point
      were their only weapons. However, no wild animals showed themselves and
      it was probable that these animals frequented more the thick forest of
      the south; but the colonists had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top
      stop in front of a large serpent that measured fourteen to fifteen feet
      in length. Neb stunned it with his club. Cyrus Smith examined this
      reptile and declared that it was not venomous because it belonged to a
      species of diamond serpents native to New South Wales. But it was
      possible that others existed whose bite was mortal, such as the deaf
      viper with a forked tail that straightens out when stepped upon, or those
      winged serpents, provided with two ear flaps that permit them to move
      very rapidly. After the first moment of surprise passed, Top gave chase
      to these reptiles so obstinately that they feared for him. His master
      continually called him back.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>Top stopped in front of a serpent.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The mouth of Red Creek, in the neighborhood of its entrance into the
      lake, was soon reached. The explorers recognized the opposite bank which
      they had visited on the descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus Smith
      established that the flow of water from the creek was rather
      considerable; it was therefore necessary that somewhere nature had
      provided an outlet for the overflow of the lake. It was this outlet that
      he was trying to discover because doubtless it formed a falls which it
      would be possible to utilize for mechanical power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were moving with a purpose but without separating much from
      each other. They began to go around the bank of the lake which was very
      steep. The waters seemed full of fish and Pencroff promised himself that
      he would make some fishing tackle in order to exploit this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was first necessary to double the sharp northeast point. One could
      suppose that the discharge of the waters was in this locality because the
      extremity of the lake was at the level of the edge of the plateau. But
      there was nothing there and the colonists continued to explore the bank
      which, after a slight curvature, became parallel to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this side the bank was less wooded but some clusters of trees,
      scattered here and there, added to the picturesqueness of the landscape.
      Lake Grant appeared then in all its expanse with no wind rippling over
      the surface of its waters. Top, beating through the brushwood, drove out
      various flocks of birds which Gideon Spilett and Herbert greeted with
      their arrows. One of the birds was skillfully hit by the young lad and
      fell among the marshy grass. Top ran toward it and brought back a
      beautiful slate colored water fowl with a short beak, a very developed
      frontal area, toes broadened by a scalloped edge, and wings with a white
      border. It was a coot, the size of a large partridge, belonging to the
      group of macrodactyls which form the transition between the order of
      waders and that of palmipeds. In short, it was a sorry game and one with
      a taste leaving much to desire. But Top doubtless would show less
      difficulty than his masters and it was decided that the coot would serve
      as his supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists then followed the east shore of the lake and they were not
      long in reaching the portion already familiar to them. The engineer was
      very surprised because he saw no indication of the discharge of the
      overflow of the water. The reporter and the sailor spoke with him and he
      could not conceal his astonishment from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Top, who had been very calm until then, gave signs of
      agitation. The intelligent animal went back and forth along the bank,
      stopped suddenly and looked at the water with a raised paw as if he had
      been on the alert for some invisible game; then he barked furiously, in a
      hunting mood so to speak, and was suddenly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Cyrus Smith nor his companions at first paid any attention to
      Top’s antics; but the dog’s barking soon became so frequent that the
      engineer became concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s there, Top?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, showing a real uneasiness, made several bounds toward his master
      and ran again toward the shore. Then he suddenly threw himself into the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here Top,” cried Cyrus Smith, who did not want his dog to venture into
      the suspicious waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s going on underneath there?” asked Pencroff, while examining the
      surface of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Top has sensed some amphibian,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An alligator, doubtless,” said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not think so,” replied Cyrus Smith. “Alligators are only met with
      in regions of lower latitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Top however came back at his master’s call and regained the shore; but he
      was unable to remain still. He leaped around in the high grass and, with
      his instinct guiding him, he seemed to follow some invisible being which
      was gliding under the waters of the lake, following the shoreline.
      Nevertheless, the water was calm and no ripple disturbed the surface.
      Several times the colonists stopped on the shore and looked carefully.
      Nothing appeared. There was some mystery there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer was very intrigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us pursue this exploration to its end,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half hour later they all arrived at the southeast corner of the lake on
      Grand View Plateau. At this point their examination of the banks of the
      lake had to be considered as completed and yet the engineer had not been
      able to discover where and how the water was discharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless this opening exists,” he repeated, “and since it is not on
      the outside it must be hollowed out inside this mass of granite on the
      coast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what importance do you attach to knowing this, my dear Cyrus?” asked
      Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A rather large one,” replied the engineer, “because if the opening is
      through this granite block, it is possible that we will find some cavity
      there which it will be easy to render habitable after having detoured the
      water.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But isn’t it possible, Mister Cyrus, that the water escapes through the
      bottom of this very lake,” said Herbert, “and that it goes to the sea by
      a subterranean passage?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is, in fact, possible,” replied the engineer, “and if that is so we
      will be obliged to build our house by ourselves since nature has not done
      the preliminary construction work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists were then getting ready to cross the plateau to get back to
      the Chimneys because it was five o’clock in the evening when Top gave new
      signs of agitation. He barked with rage and before his master could
      restrain him he threw himself a second time into the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone ran toward the shore. The dog was already more than twenty feet
      away and Cyrus Smith was sharply calling him when an enormous head
      emerged from the surface of the water which did not appear to be deep at
      this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert recognized at once this species of amphibian which has a tapered
      head with large eyes and whose mustache is decorated with long silky
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A manatee!” he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a manatee, but a specimen of this species of the order of
      cetaceans which carries the name of “dugong” because its nostrils are
      open at the upper part of its snout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enormous animal threw itself on the dog who vainly tried to escape
      him and return to the shore. His master could do nothing to save him, and
      even before it occurred to Gideon Spilett or to Herbert to arm their
      bows, Top, seized by the dugong, disappeared under the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, his iron tipped spear in hand, wanted to help the dog by attacking
      the formidable animal in its own element.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Neb,” said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      However an inexplicable battle was going on under the water. Under these
      conditions Top evidently could not resist. Judging from the bubbles on
      the surface, this was a terrible battle which could only end finally in
      the death of the dog. But suddenly in the middle of a circle of foam, Top
      reappeared. Thrown into the air by some unknown force, he rose ten feet
      above the surface of the lake, falling in the midst of the profoundly
      troubled water. He soon regained the shore without any deep wound,
      miraculously saved.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

        <b>Top, thrown into the air...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions looked on without understanding. There was
      yet another inexplicable circumstance. The battle was still continuing
      under the water. Doubtless the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal
      after having released the dog, was fighting on its own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this did not last long. The water became red with blood and the body
      of the dugong emerged within a wide scarlet area, soon becoming stranded
      on a small beach on the southern corner of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists ran toward this spot. The dugong was dead. It was an
      enormous animal, fifteen feet long, weighing three to four thousand
      pounds. There was a wound on its neck which seemed to have been made with
      a sharp blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was this amphibian which had been able to destroy the formidable
      dugong with this terrible blow? No one could say and rather preoccupied
      with this incident, Cyrus Smith and his companions returned to the
      Chimneys.
