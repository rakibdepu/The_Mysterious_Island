      <b class="cap">Cyrus Smith's</b> project had succeeded; but following his
      custom he remained immobile, without showing any satisfaction, his lips
      tight, his gaze steady. Herbert was enthusiastic; Neb jumped for joy;
      Pencroff swayed his large head and murmured these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our engineer does well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the nitroglycerin had acted powerfully. The drain from the lake
      was so large that the volume of water which now escaped by this new
      passage was at least triple that which had formerly passed through the
      old way. The result was that in a short period of time after the
      operation, the level of the lake was lowered by at least two feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists returned to the Chimneys in order to take picks, iron
      tipped spears, fiber cords, flint and tinder; they then returned to the
      plateau. Top accompanied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way, the sailor could not refrain from saying to the engineer:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know, Mister Cyrus, that by means of this charming liquid that
      you have made, we could blow up our entire island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without a doubt, the island, continents and the Earth itself,” replied
      Cyrus Smith. “It is only a question of quantity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can’t you then use this nitroglycerin to load any weapons?” asked the
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Pencroff, because it is too quick. But it will be easy to make
      cotton powder or even ordinary powder since we have nitric acid,
      saltpeter, sulphur and coal. Unhappily it is the weapons we do not have.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor, “with a little determination...”
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly, Pencroff had erased the word “impossible” from the Lincoln
      Island dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, on arriving at Grand View Plateau, immediately went to the
      point on the lake near the opening of the old overflow which was now
      uncovered. The passageway had become practical since the water no longer
      ran there and it would doubtless be easy to determine its interior
      arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the colonists reached the lower corner of the lake and a
      quick glance sufficed to ascertain that the result had been achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, within the granite wall of the lake, and now above the level of
      the water, the long sought opening appeared. A narrow shoulder, left bare
      by the retreating water, allowed an entrance. This opening measured about
      twenty feet in length but only two feet in height. It was like the mouth
      of a sewer at the end of a pavement. This opening would not allow the
      colonists an easy passage; but Neb and Pencroff took the pick and in less
      than an hour they had given it a sufficient height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer then went near it and discovered that the walls of the
      passageway, in its upper part, did not show a slope of more than 30 to
      35°. It was therefore practical and, provided the decline did not
      increase, it would be easy to descend to the level of the sea. If, as was
      very likely, some vast cavern existed inside this granite mass, they
      would perhaps find some way to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Mister Cyrus, why are we stopping?” asked the sailor, impatient to
      venture into the narrow corridor. “You see that Top is already ahead of
      us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied the engineer, “we must see clearly. Neb, go and cut off
      some resinous branches.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb and Herbert ran toward the banks of the lake, shaded by pines and
      other green trees, and they soon returned with branches that they formed
      into torches. These torches were kindled by sparks from the flint and,
      Cyrus Smith at the head, the colonists entered the dark passageway which
      had been filled with water not too long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to what one would expect, the diameter of the passageway
      increased so that soon the explorers could stand up while descending. The
      granite walls, in contact with water for an immeasurable time, were
      slippery, so they had to guard against falls. The colonists were tied to
      one another by a cord as is done by mountain climbers. Happily, a few
      granite ledges, forming real steps, rendered the descent less perilous.
      Some drops, still suspended from the rocks, were iridescent under the
      flames of the torches, and it seemed that the walls were covered with
      innumerable stalactites. The engineer observed this black granite. He saw
      not a stratum, not a geological fault. The mass was compact and of an
      extremely close grain. This passageway dated from the very origin of the
      island. It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it.
      Pluto and not Neptune had bored it and on the wall they could distinguish
      traces of eruptive activity which the flow of water had not been able to
      erase completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists descended only very slowly. They were not without a certain
      emotion in venturing thus into the depths of this mass which human beings
      were evidently visiting for the first time. They did not speak but
      reflected and the thought came to more than one of them that some octopus
      or other gigantic cephalopod could occupy these interior cavities which
      found communication with the sea. It was hence necessary to venture forth
      with a certain prudence.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>The colonists descended slowly.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Besides, Top was at the head of this small troop and they could depend on
      the dog’s sagacity. He would not fail to give the alarm should it be
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having descended about a hundred feet, following a rather winding
      path, Cyrus Smith, who was ahead, stopped and his companions joined him.
      The spot where they had stopped was hollowed out, forming a cavern of
      moderate dimension. Drops of water fell from its arch but this did not
      prove any leak through the mass. It was simply the last traces left by
      the torrent which had roared so long through this cavity. The somewhat
      humid air did not emit any noxious emanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, my dear Cyrus,” Gideon Spilett then said. “Here is an unknown
      retreat well hidden in these depths but, in sum, it is uninhabitable.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why uninhabitable?” asked the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because it is too small and too dark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can we not enlarge it, hollow it out and make openings to let in
      daylight and air,” replied Pencroff, who no longer doubted anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us continue,” replied Cyrus Smith. “Let us continue our exploration.
      Perhaps lower down nature will have saved us this work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are still only a third of the way down,” Herbert noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “About a third,” replied Cyrus Smith, “because we have descended about a
      hundred feet from the opening and it is not impossible that a hundred
      feet lower down...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where is Top?...” asked Neb, interrupting his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      They searched the cavern. The dog was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He probably continued along the path,” said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us join him,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descent was resumed. The engineer carefully observed the deviations
      of the passageway and, in spite of the detours, he could rather easily
      render an account of its general direction, which went toward the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists had gone down about another fifty feet, measured
      perpendicularly, when their attention was drawn to some remote sounds
      which came from the depths of the mass. They stopped and listened. These
      sounds, carried along the corridor like a voice across an acoustical
      tube, reached the ear clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is Top’s barks!” cried Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Pencroff, “and our worthy dog barks furiously.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have our iron tipped spears,” said Cyrus Smith. “Let us be on guard
      and advance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is getting to be more and more interesting,” murmured Gideon
      Spilett into the ear of the sailor, who made an affirmative sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions ran to the dog’s assistance. Top’s barking
      became more and more perceptible. They sensed in his staccato voice a
      strange rage. Was he at grips with some animal whose retreat he had
      disturbed? One could say that the colonists were now possessed by an
      irresistible curiosity and not thinking of the danger to which they were
      exposed. They were not merely descending the corridor, they could say
      that they were gliding along its sides and in a few minutes, sixty feet
      lower down, they rejoined Top.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the corridor materialized into a vast and magnificent cavern. There
      Top, coming and going, barked furiously. Pencroff and Neb, shaking their
      torches, threw light into every crevice of the granite while Cyrus Smith,
      Gideon Spilett, Herbert, spears in position, were ready for any
      eventuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enormous cavern was empty. The colonists went through all of it.
      There was nothing there, not an animal, not a living being. Nevertheless,
      Top continued to bark. Neither caresses nor threats could silence him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There must be some outlet through which the lake’s water reaches the
      sea,” said the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact,” replied Pencroff, “we should take care not to fall into a
      hole.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, Top, go!” shouted Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, excited by his master’s words, ran toward the extremity of the
      cavern and there his barking redoubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed him and, by the light of the torches, the orifice of a real
      well appeared opening into the granite. It was here that the water left
      after having entered the granite mass but this time there was no longer
      an oblique and practical corridor but a perpendicular well into which it
      was impossible to venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torches were inclined over the orifice. They saw nothing. Cyrus Smith
      detached a flaming branch and threw it into the abyss. The resinous
      fragment, burning brighter because of the rapidity of its fall,
      illuminated the inside of the well, but still nothing appeared. Then the
      flame extinguished with a slight simmer, indicating that it had reached
      the layer of water, that is to say, sea level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, calculating the time of fall, was able to estimate the
      depth of the well, which he found to be about ninety feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floor of the cavern was therefore situated at ninety feet above sea
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here is our dwelling,” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it was occupied by some creature,” replied Gideon Spilett, who did
      not find his curiosity satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, whatever this creature, amphibian or otherwise, it has fled by
      this opening,” replied the engineer, “and he has surrendered this place
      to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind,” added the sailor. “I would like to be Top for a quarter of
      an hour because he does not bark without reason.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith looked at his dog and those of his companions who were near
      him would have heard him murmur these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I really believe that Top knows a lot more about these things than
      we do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the needs of the colonists were in large part realized. Chance,
      aided by the marvelous sagacity of their chief, had happily served them.
      They had here at their disposal a vast cavern whose size they still could
      not estimate from the light of the insufficient torches, but it would
      certainly be easy to divide it into rooms, by means of brick partitions,
      and to adapt it, if not like a house, at least into a spacious apartment.
      The water had abandoned it and could not return. The place was vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two difficulties remained: first, the question of lighting this
      excavation hollowed out in a solid block; second the need for easier
      access. As to illumination, they could not dream of establishing it from
      above because of the enormous thickness of granite above them; but
      perhaps they could pierce the outer wall which faced the sea. Cyrus Smith
      who, during the descent, had measured the obliquity approximately, and
      consequently the length of the passageway, was led to believe that the
      outside wall could not be very thick. If illumination was obtained in
      this way, there would also be access, because it would be just as easy to
      make a door and an outside ladder as to make windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith shared his ideas with his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To work then, Mister Cyrus,” replied Pencroff. “I have my pick and I
      will know how to bring daylight through this wall. Where should I
      strike?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here,” replied the engineer, indicating to the vigorous sailor a rather
      considerable recess in the wall which would diminish the thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff attacked the granite and for a half hour, by the light of the
      torches, he made the splinters fly around him. The rock sparkled under
      his pick. Neb relieved him, then Gideon Spilett after Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work had already lasted for two hours and they began to believe that
      the wall at this spot exceeded the length of the pick when, with a last
      blow given by Gideon Spilett, the instrument passed through the wall and
      fell outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah! Forever and ever hurrah!” cried Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wall there measured only three feet in thickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith placed his eye against the opening, which overlooked the
      ground from a height of eighty feet. The beach extended before him, the
      islet, and beyond that the immense sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opening was rather large because the rock had disintegrated
      significantly. Light flooded in and produced a magical effect, inundating
      this splendid cavern. If, on its left side, it did not measure more than
      thirty feet in height and in width and a hundred feet in length, on its
      right side, in contrast, it was enormous and its dome was rounded at a
      height of more than eighty feet. In some places irregularly disposed
      granite pillars supported springers like those of the nave of a
      cathedral. Resting on sort of lateral columns, here overlayed with
      arches, there rising on ogival ribs, lost in obscure bays whose
      capricious arches they could barely see in the shadows, ornamented by a
      profusion of ledges which were formed like so many pendants, this vault
      offered a picturesque mixture of all the Byzantine, Roman and Gothic
      architecture produced by the hand of man. But this nevertheless, was only
      the work of nature. It alone had hollowed out this fairylike Alhambra
      into this massif of granite.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>This dome was similar to a nave of a cathedral.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The colonists were stupefied with admiration. Where they had expected to
      find only a narrow cavity, they found a marvelous palace and Neb took off
      his hat as if he had been transported into a temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cries of admiration were heard from all lips. Hurrahs resounded as echo
      upon echo were repeated and lost in the depths of the somber naves.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, my friends,” cried Cyrus Smith. “When we light up the interior of
      this massif, when we have arranged our rooms and our stores on the left
      side, this splendid cavern will still remain, which will be our study
      hall and our museum.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And we will call it?...” asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Granite House,” replied Cyrus Smith, a name which his companions greeted
      with more of their hurrahs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the torches were nearly entirely consumed and since they
      must ascend the corridor in order to return to the summit of the plateau,
      it was decided to postpone for the next day the labors relating to the
      arrangements in the new dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving, Cyrus Smith leaned once more over the somber pit which
      was hollowed out perpendicularly down to the level of the sea. He
      listened carefully. There was no noise, not even from the water whose
      surging vibrations sometimes agitate these depths. A burning resin was
      once more thrown in. The walls of the pit were lit up for a moment but,
      like the first time, it revealed nothing suspicious. If some marine
      monster had been unexpectedly surprised by the retreat of the water, he
      had by now regained the open sea by means of the subterranean passageway
      that went under the beach, a path followed by the overflow from the lake
      before a new outlet was offered to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer, however, remained immobile, listening carefully and looking
      into the gulf. He did not say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor then approached him and touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Smith?” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you wish, my friend?” replied the engineer, as if returning from
      the land of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The torches will soon be extinguished.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small troop left the cavern and began to climb up the somber
      passageway. Top was at the rear still making those singular growls. The
      climb was a rather steep one. The colonists stopped for several moments
      at the upper grotto which formed a sort of landing at the midpoint of
      this long granite stairway. Then they began to climb again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they felt fresher air. The drops, dried by evaporation, no longer
      scintillated on the walls. The light from the fading torches became
      smoky. The one carried by Neb was extinguished and, in order not to
      venture in profound darkness, they must hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done and a little before four o’clock, just as the sailor’s
      torch was extinguished in its turn, Cyrus Smith and his companions
      emerged from the passageway.
