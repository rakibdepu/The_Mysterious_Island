    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">Yes,</b> the unfortunate had cried! Some remembrance
      doubtless had crossed his mind and, to use Cyrus Smith’s expression, he
      had become a man again by his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists left him for a while on the plateau and even withdrew a
      little so that he could feel free; but he no longer thought of profiting
      from this liberty and Cyrus Smith shortly decided to bring him back to
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after this scene the stranger seemed to want to mix a little
      with the community life. It was evident that he heard and that he
      understood but it was none the less evident that he was strangely
      obstinate in not speaking to the colonists because one evening Pencroff,
      putting his ear to the door of his room, heard these words escape from
      his lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No! here! me! never!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor related these words to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is some painful mystery here,” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger began to use some tools and worked in the garden. When he
      paused in his work, which was often, he remained as if concentrating on
      himself; but, at the engineer’s recommendation, they respected this
      isolation which he seemed to want to protect. If one of the colonists
      approached him he withdrew and sobs came from his chest as if full of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he overcome by remorse? It seemed so, and Gideon Spilett could not
      refrain one day from making this observation:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he does not speak it is because he has, I believe, things too grave
      to talk about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They would have to be patient and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days later, the third of November, the stranger, working on the
      plateau, stopped and let his spade fall to the ground. Cyrus Smith, who
      observed him a little distance away, saw the tears flow from his eyes
      once more. He felt an irresistible pity for him and he gently touched his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger tried to avoid his gaze, and since Cyrus Smith wanted to
      take his hand, he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” said Cyrus Smith in a firm voice, “look at me, I wish it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked at the engineer and seemed to be under his influence
      like a hypnotized person under the power of a hypnotist. He wanted to
      flee. But then his countenance changed. His look emitted a flash. Words
      tried to escape from his lips. He could no longer hold them in... Finally
      he crossed his arms; then in a hollow voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you?” he asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/523.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>“Who are you?” he asked Cyrus Smith.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      “Castaways, like yourself,” replied the engineer, with deep emotion. “We
      have brought you here to be with your fellow men.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My fellow men!... I do not have any.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are among friends...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Friends!... me! friends!” The stranger shouted, hiding his head in his
      hands. “No... never... leave me alone... leave me alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he ran to the edge of the plateau which overlooked the sea and
      remained there immobile for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith rejoined his companions and related what had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! There is a mystery in this man’s life,” said Gideon Spilett, “and
      it seems that he will return to humanity only by the path of remorse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hardly know what kind of a man we have brought here,” said the sailor.
      “He has secrets...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which we will respect,” replied Cyrus Smith vividly. “If he has
      committed some mistake he has severely expiated it and in our eyes he is
      absolved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours the stranger remained alone, evidently under the influence
      of past memories—a disastrous past doubtless—and the colonists, without
      losing sight of him, did not disturb his privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after two hours, he appeared to have come to a decision and he
      went to find Cyrus Smith. His eyes were red from the tears that had
      poured forth, but he was no longer crying. He had a look of deep
      humility. He seemed timid, bashful, very humble and he constantly gazed
      at the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir,” he said to Cyrus Smith, “your companions and you, are you
      English?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the engineer, “we are Americans.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” said the stranger, and he murmured these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I much prefer that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And you, my friend?” asked the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “English,” he replied hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as these words were hard to say, he ran to the shore to the area
      between the cascade and the mouth of the Mercy. He was extremely
      agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, passing near Herbert for a moment he stopped and in a strange
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      “What month?” he asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “December,” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What year?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “1866.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Twelve years! twelve years,” he shouted. Then he left abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert related to the colonists the questions and answers that had been
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This unfortunate,” Gideon Spilett noted, “was no longer aware of months
      or years,”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” added Herbert, “and he was already twelve years on the islet when
      we found him there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Twelve years!” replied Cyrus Smith. “Ah! twelve years of isolation after
      a cursed existence perhaps could deprive any man of his sanity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am led to believe,” Pencroff then said, “that this man did not reach
      Tabor Island as a castaway but that he was abandoned there as a result of
      some crime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may be right, Pencroff,” replied the reporter, “and if that is so,
      it is not impossible that those who left him there will return to look
      for him one day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And they will no longer find him,” said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But then,” replied Pencroff, “they must leave again and...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friends,” said Cyrus Smith, “let us not consider this question before
      we know what we have to contend with. I believe that this unfortunate has
      suffered, that he has harshly expiated his mistakes, whatever they be,
      and that he has the need to unburden himself. Let us not provoke him to
      tell us his story. He will doubtless tell it to us and when we have
      learned it, we will see what course it is best to follow. Besides, he
      alone can tell us if he still hopes to he rescued one day, but I doubt
      it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And why?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because in the event that he had been assured of being delivered within
      a certain time, he would have waited for the hour of his deliverance and
      he would not have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is rather
      probable that he was condemned to die on this islet and that he would
      never be able to see his fellow beings again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” noted the sailor, “there is one thing that I have been unable to
      explain to myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Which is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If it is twelve years since this man has been abandoned on Tabor Island,
      then we may surely suppose that he was already for several years in the
      savage state in which we found him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is probable,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would consequently be several years since he had written this
      document.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doubtless... and yet the document seems to have been recently
      written!...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Besides, wouldn’t the bottle which enclosed the document have taken
      several years to go from Tabor Island to Lincoln Island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not absolutely impossible,” replied the reporter. “Could it not
      already have been a long time in the vicinity of the island?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied Pencroff, “because it was still floating. We cannot even
      assume that after having remained on the beach for a longer or a shorter
      time it was returned to the sea because there are so many rocks on the
      southern coast that it would surely have broken.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Right,” replied Cyrus Smith, who remained absorbed in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So,” added the sailor, “if the document was written several years ago,
      if it was enclosed in this bottle for several years, it would have been
      damaged by the dampness. Now, there is nothing of the sort, and we find
      it in perfect condition.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor was right. It was an incomprehensible fact, because when the
      colonists found the document in the bottle, it seemed to have been
      recently written. In addition, it gave the position of Tabor Island in
      latitude and in longitude with precision which implied that its author
      had a rather complete knowledge of hydrography which a simple sailor
      could not have.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Once again we have here something inexplicable,” said the engineer, “but
      let us not provoke our new companion to speak. When he wishes it, my
      friends, we will be ready to listen to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      During the days which followed, the stranger did not say a word nor did
      he at any time leave the confines of the plateau. He worked the ground,
      without losing a moment, without taking a moment’s rest, but always in
      solitude. At mealtimes he did not go to Granite House although invited
      several times to do so and he was content to eat some raw vegetables.
      When night came, he did not go back to the room which had been assigned
      to him but he remained there under some cluster of trees or, when the
      weather was bad he crouched in some cavity among the rocks. Thus he still
      lived like the time when there was no other shelter than the forests of
      Tabor Island and, since any attempt to get him to change his life was in
      vain, the colonists waited patiently. But the time had to come when his
      conscience would force him to reveal his terrible crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of November, at about eight o’clock in the evening, when
      night was coming on, the stranger unexpectedly presented himself to the
      colonists who were gathered under the veranda. His eyes were blazing
      strangely and his entire person had taken on the fierce aspect of his
      former days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions were taken aback on seeing him under the
      influence of this terrible emotion, his teeth clacking like someone in a
      fever. What was this about? Was the sight of his fellow men unbearable?
      Had he had enough of this honest existence? Did he have a nostalgia for
      his brutish life? They were led to think this on hearing him express
      these incoherent phrases:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why am I here?... What right did you have to drag me from my islet?...
      Is there any bond between you and me?... Do you know who I am... what I
      have done... why I was there... alone? And how do you know that I wasn’t
      abandoned there... that I wasn’t condemned to die there?... Do you know
      my past?... How do you know that I am not a thief, an assassin... that I
      am not worthless... a wretch... fit to live like a wild beast... away
      from everyone... speak... do you know this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists listened without interrupting the unfortunate who was half
      confessing in spite of himself. Cyrus Smith, wanting to calm him,
      approached, but he drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No!, no!” he shouted. “One word only... am I free?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are free,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Goodbye then!” he shouted, and fled like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb, Pencroff and Herbert immediately ran to the edge of the forest...
      but they returned alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He needs to get away,” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He will never return...” shouted Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He will return,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the days passed; but Cyrus Smith—was it a sort of
      premonition?—persisted in the firm idea that the unfortunate would return
      sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is the last revolt of his wild nature,” he said, “which is affected
      by remorse and which a new seclusion will terrify.”
    </p>
    <p>
      However various activities of all sorts were continued. Cyrus Smith
      intended to build a farm either at Grand View Plateau or at the corral.
      It goes without saying that the seed collected by Herbert on Tabor Island
      had been carefully planted. The plateau then became a large kitchen
      garden, well arranged and well maintained which the colonists did not
      cease to work. They were always laboring there. As the vegetables
      multiplied, they had to enlarge the simple squares which tended to
      develop into real fields and replace the prairie. But forage was
      plentiful in other parts of the island and the onagers never had to fear
      any rationing. Besides, it was better to transform Grand View Plateau
      into a kitchen garden shielded as it was by a deep belt of creeks and to
      leave to the outside the prairies which had no need to be protected
      against the depredations of quadrumanes and quadrupeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 15th they had the third harvest. The area had grown in the
      eighteen months since the first grain of corn had been planted. The
      second harvest of six hundred thousand grains this time produced four
      thousand bushels which is more than five hundred million grains. The
      colony was rich in corn because it would suffice to sow about ten bushels
      each year to assure a harvest from which every one, man and beast, could
      be nourished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harvest was then completed and they devoted the last half of the
      month of November to making it into bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, they had the grain but not the flour so the installation of a
      mill was necessary. Cyrus Smith could have used the second fall which
      overflowed into the Mercy for his motor power, the first being already
      used to drive the rammers of the fulling mill; but after discussion it
      was decided that they would establish a simple windmill on the heights of
      Grand View. The construction of one did not offer any more difficulty
      than the construction of the other, and they were sure, on the other
      hand, that there would be no lack of wind on this plateau exposed as it
      was to the open sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Without counting,” said Pencroff, “that this windmill would be pretty
      and would have a good effect on the landscape.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They began the work by choosing timber for the framework of the cage and
      for the mechanism of the mill. Several large sandstones found to the
      north of the lake were easily transformed into grindstones and as to the
      arms, the inexhaustible envelope of the balloon furnished the necessary
      cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith made his plans and the location for the mill was chosen a
      little to the right of the poultry yard, near the banks of the lake. The
      entire cage rested on a pivot supported by the main framework so as to be
      able to turn with the entire mechanism which it contained, according to
      the demands of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work was quickly accomplished. Neb and Pencroff had become very
      skilful carpenters and they had only to follow the model furnished by the
      engineer. A sort of cylindrical turret, topped by a roof, soon rose at
      the designated place. The four frames which formed the arms were firmly
      implanted into a shaft so as to make a certain angle with it and were
      fixed to it by means of iron bolts. As to the various parts of the
      internal mechanism, the box destined to contain the two grindstones, the
      stationary stone and the turning stone, the hopper which was a sort of
      square spout, large on top and narrow at the base, which would permit the
      grains to fall on the grindstones, the oscillating spout designed to
      regulate the flow of grain and to which its perpetual tic-tac would give
      it the name of “blabbermouth,” and finally the sieve which, by the
      operation of the sifter, separated the bran from the flour, all these
      were made without difficulty. The tools were good and the work presented
      little difficulty because, in short, the mechanism of a mill is very
      simple. It is only a question of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone worked on the construction of the mill and on the 1st of
      December it was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, Pencroff was enchanted with his work and he did not doubt but
      that his apparatus was perfect.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/532.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>Pencroff was enchanted with his work.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      “Now for a good wind,” he said, “and we will merrily grind our first
      harvest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A good wind, so be it,” replied the engineer, “but not too much wind,
      Pencroff.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah! our mill will only turn faster”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not necessary that it turn so fast,” replied Cyrus Smith. “It is
      known from experience that the greatest amount of work is produced by a
      mill when the number of rotations of the arms per minute is six times the
      speed of the wind in feet per second. With a moderate breeze which gives
      a speed of twenty four feet per second, it will impart sixteen
      revolutions per minute to the arms which is no more than we need.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Right!” shouted Herbert. “A jolly breeze is blowing from the northeast
      which will do our work.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason to delay the inauguration of the mill because the
      colonists were in a hurry to taste the first piece of bread from Lincoln
      Island. On this day then, in the afternoon, two or three bushels of corn
      were ground and the next day at lunch a magnificent loaf, a bit compact
      perhaps even though raised with brewer’s yeast, appeared on the table of
      Granite House. Everyone bit off huge chunks and with what pleasure as one
      can imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      However the stranger had not reappeared. Several times Gideon Spilett and
      Herbert had gone to the forest in the neighborhood of Granite House
      without encountering him and without finding any trace of him. This
      prolonged disappearance made them very anxious. Certainly the old savage
      from Tabor Island would have no difficulty keeping alive in these forests
      of the Far West so full of game, but wasn’t it to be feared that he would
      return to his old habits and that this independence would revive his wild
      instincts? By a sort of premonition, Cyrus Smith always persisted in
      saying that, without doubt, the fugitive would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, he will return,” he repeated with a confidence which his companions
      could not share. “When this unfortunate was on Tabor Island he knew
      himself to be alone. Here he knows that his fellow beings await him.
      Since he has half spoken of his past life, he has repented, and he will
      return to tell us the entire story and from that day on he will be one of
      us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The event showed that Cyrus Smith was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 3rd of December, Herbert had left Grand View Plateau to go fishing
      on the southern bank of the lake. He was without weapons and until then
      there had never been any precaution to take since dangerous animals had
      not shown themselves on this part of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this while, Pencroff and Neb were working at the poultry yard
      while Cyrus Smith and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys making
      soda, the supply of soap being exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly these shouts resounded:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Help me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and the reporter, being too far away, could not hear these
      shouts. Pencroff and Neb, quickly abandoning the poultry yard, ran toward
      the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they arrived they saw the stranger, whose presence in this
      neighborhood no one suspected, crossing Glycerin Creek which separated
      the plateau from the forest and jump to the opposite bank.

      There, Herbert was face to face with a formidable jaguar which resembled
      the one that had been killed at Reptile Promontory. Suddenly surprised,
      he stood against a tree while the animal was getting ready to leap upon
      him... But the stranger, without any weapon other than a knife, hurled
      himself on the redoubtable beast who turned toward this new adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was a short one. The stranger had strength and prodigious
      skill. With one hand, as powerful as a shear, he seized the jaguar by the
      throat without bothering with the beast’s claws which penetrated into his
      flesh, and with the other hand he dug his knife into the animal’s heart.

      The jaguar fell. The stranger kicked it aside and was about to flee just
      as the colonists reached the field of battle. Herbert held him back
      shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No! No! You will not go!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith went toward the stranger who frowned when he saw him
      approach. The blood was flowing under his torn shirt but he took no
      notice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend,” Cyrus Smith said to him, “we are indebted to you. You risked
      your life to save our child.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My life!” murmured the stranger. “What is it worth? Less than nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are wounded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s of little importance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you give me your hand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Herbert tried to grasp the hand that had saved him, the stranger
      crossed his arms, swelled up his chest, his look became clouded and he
      seemed to want to flee; but making a violent effort to control himself
      and in an abrupt tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you,” he asked, “and what do you claim to be to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the colonists’ story that he was thus asking for, and for the
      first time. Perhaps, if this story was related, would he tell his own?
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words, Cyrus Smith related all that had occurred since their
      departure from Richmond, how they had managed their affairs, and what
      resources were now available to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger listened carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer spoke for everyone, for Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroff,
      Neb and himself and added that the greatest joy that they had experienced
      since their arrival on Lincoln Island was their return from the islet
      when they had been able to count an additional companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the latter blushed, lowered his head on his chest and
      became confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now that you know about us,” added Cyrus Smith, “will you give us
      your hand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied the stranger in a hollow voice, “no! You are honest men,
      you! and I!...”
