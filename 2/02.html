    <p class="huge">
      <b class="cap">On</b> October 29th the bark canoe was completely
      finished. Pencroff had kept his promise and in five days a sort of canoe,
      whose hull was ribbed with the flexible wood of the crejimba, had been
      constructed. A seat in the rear, a second seat in the middle to maintain
      the separation, a third seat in front, a flat board to support the tholes
      of two oars, a stern oar to steer, made up this twelve foot long boat
      which did not weigh two hundred pounds. As to the launching operation, it
      was extremely simple. The light canoe was carried to the sand on the
      shore in front of Granite House and the rising tide lifted it up.
      Pencroff immediately jumped in, worked in the scull and declared that it
      was very suitable for whatever use they wanted to make of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah!” cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate his own
      triumph in this way. “With this we can make a tour...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of the world?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, of the island. Some rocks for ballast, a mast up front and a bit of
      a sail which Mister Smith will make for us one day and we will go far.
      Well, Mister Cyrus and you Mister Spilett and you Herbert and you Neb,
      aren’t you going to try out our new boat? The devil! Let’s see if it can
      carry all five of us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, this was a test to make. Pencroff, with a stroke of the scull,
      brought the boat to the shore through a narrow passage among the rocks
      and it was agreed that they would try out the canoe on this very day by
      following the shoreline up to the first point where the rocks in the
      south came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of embarking, Neb cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But your boat leaks badly, Pencroff!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s nothing, Neb,” replied the sailor. “It is necessary for the wood
      to become watertight. In two days it will no longer be apparent and our
      canoe will have no more water inside it than there is in the stomach of
      drunkard. Embark!”
    </p>
    <p>
      They then got in and Pencroff drove out. The weather was magnificent, the
      sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the narrow banks of a
      lake and the canoe could confront the sea with as much security as if it
      were ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other and Pencroff stayed in the
      rear of the boat in order to work the scull.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor first crossed the channel, grazing the southern point of the
      islet. A light wind blew from the south. There was no swell neither in
      the channel nor on the sea. Several long waves that the canoe hardly felt
      because it was heavily loaded, regularly swelled the surface of the sea.
      They went out about a half mile from shore in order to see all of Mount
      Franklin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff went along the shore to the mouth of the river. The canoe then
      followed the rounded shoreline up to its end point, which hid all of the
      marshy Tadorns plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point, whose distance was increased by the curvature of the coast,
      was about three miles from the Mercy. The colonists decided to go to its
      end and to pass it only a little in order to take a quick look at the
      coast up to Cape Claw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe therefore followed the coast at a distance of two cables at
      most, thus avoiding the rocks strewn on the shoreline, which were
      beginning to be covered by the rising tide. The wall became lower from
      the river’s mouth up to the point. It was a pile of granite blocks,
      randomly distributed, of an extremely savage aspect and very different
      from the facade that formed Grand View Plateau. One would have said that
      an enormous cartload of rocks had been emptied there. There was no
      vegetation on this very sharp salient which extended for two miles in
      front of the forest and this point looked very much like the arms of a
      giant who was about to emerge from a channel of foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe, moved by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon
      Spilett, pencil in one hand, notebook in the other, sketched the coast in
      large strokes. Neb, Pencroff and Herbert chatted while examining this new
      part of their domain and as the canoe moved southward, the two Mandible
      Capes appeared to shift and enclose Union Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Cyrus Smith, he looked but said nothing and from the mistrust
      expressed by his look, it seemed as if he were observing some strange
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after a navigation of three quarters of an hour, the canoe
      arrived at the extremity of the point, and Pencroff prepared to double it
      when Herbert, getting up, pointed to a black spot and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do I see there on the beach?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone looked toward the indicated point.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact,” said the reporter, “something is there. One would say a piece
      of wreckage half buried in the sand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” cried Pencroff, “I see what it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” asked Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Barrels, barrels, which may be full,” replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To shore, Pencroff,” said Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few strokes of the oar, the canoe landed in a small cove and the
      passengers leaped to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the
      sand but still securely attached to a large case which, held up by the
      water, had floated in this way until the moment when it had become
      stranded on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has there been a wreck hereabout on the island?” asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Evidently,” replied Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what is in this case?” cried Pencroff, naturally impatient. “What is
      in this case? It is locked and there’s nothing to break the lid. Well, a
      few blows with a rock then.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="../pics/313.jpg" border="1" width="324" height="466" alt=

        <b>“But what is in this case?”</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And the sailor, picking up a heavy block, went to break open one of the
      sides of the case when the engineer stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pencroff,” he said to him, “can you restrain your impatience for only an
      hour?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But just think, Mister Cyrus. Perhaps everything we need is inside.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will know, Pencroff,” replied the engineer, “but believe me, do not
      break this case which may be useful to us. Let us transport it to Granite
      House where we will open it more easily and without breaking it. It is
      fully prepared for the voyage and since it has floated this far it will
      also float to the river’s mouth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right, Mister Cyrus, and I am wrong,” replied the sailor, “but I
      am not always in control of myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer’s advice was sensible. In fact, the canoe would not be able
      to hold the objects which were probably enclosed in the case. They had to
      be heavy since it was necessary to relieve the load by means of two empty
      barrels. Thus, it would be better to tow it as is to the beach in front
      of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now from whence came this wreckage? This was an important question.
      Cyrus Smith and his companions carefully looked around and scoured the
      shore for a space of several hundred feet. No other debris appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea was also observed. Herbert and Neb climbed to a high rock but the
      horizon was deserted. Nothing was in sight, neither a disabled ship nor a
      vessel under sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps even,
      this incident was associated with the incident of the lead bullet?
      Perhaps some strangers had landed on another point of the island? Perhaps
      they were still there? But the colonists could see that these strangers
      could not be Malayan pirates because the wreck was evidently of American
      or European origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone returned to the case which measured five feet in length by three
      in width. It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered by a
      thick skin held in place with copper nails. The two large barrels,
      hermetically sealed but sounding empty, were tied by means of strong
      cords and knotted by knots which Pencroff easily recognized as “sailor’s
      knots”. It appeared to be in a perfect state of preservation, which was
      explained by the fact that it had run aground on a sandy beach and not on
      the reefs. On examining it carefully, they could even say that its
      sojourn on the sea had not been long and also that its arrival on the
      shore was recent. The water did not seem to have penetrated inside and
      the objects which it contained would be intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that this case had been thrown overboard from a disabled
      vessel heading toward the island and that, in the hope that it would
      reach the island where they would later recover it, the passengers had
      taken the precaution of lightening it by means of a floating apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will tow this wreckage to Granite House” said the engineer, “and we
      will make an inventory of it; then if we find some survivors of this
      presumed wreck on the island, we will return the contents to them. If we
      find no one...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will keep it for ourselves,” cried Pencroff. “But, by God, what is
      inside?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the tide began to reach the wreck, which evidently could float in
      the open sea. One of the cords attached to the barrels was partly
      unraveled and used to tie the floating apparatus to the canoe. Then
      Pencroff and Neb excavated into the sand with their oars in order to
      facilitate the movement of the case. Soon the boat, towing the case,
      began to double the point which was given the name Flotsam Point. The
      towing was sluggish and the barrels were barely sufficient to hold the
      case above the water. The sailor feared that at any moment it would
      detach and sink to the bottom. But happily his fears were not realized
      and an hour and a half after leaving—it took all this time to travel this
      distance of three miles—the canoe came alongside the beach in front of
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canoe and case were then hauled onto the sand and since the tide was
      already going down it was not long in leaving it high and dry. Neb
      brought tools to force the case in a way that would damage it as little
      as possible and they proceeded to its inventory. Pencroff could not hide
      his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor began by detaching the two barrels which, being in very good
      condition, would find uses, that goes without saying. Then the locks were
      forced with a crowbar and the lid was taken off at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      A double envelope of zinc lined the interior of the case which had
      evidently been designed so that the enclosed objects would be protected
      from the dampness under all circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” cried Neb, “what if there are preserves inside?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope not,” replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If only there was...,” said the sailor in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” asked Neb, who overhead him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The zinc cover was broken along its entire length, then turned down on
      the sides of the case and little by little various objects of different
      kinds were extracted and placed on the sand. With each new object,
      Pencroff gave out new hurrahs, Herbert clapped and Neb danced. There were
      books which made Herbert mad with joy and kitchen utensils which Neb
      covered with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the remainder, the colonists were extremely satisfied because the
      case contained tools, arms, instruments, clothes, books, and here is the
      exact nomenclature as written in Gideon Spilett’s notebook.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>As to the remainder, the colonists were satisfied.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <i>Tools:</i> three knives with several blades, two woodsman’s axes, two
      carpenter’s axes, three planes, two adzes, one twibil, six cold chisels,
      two files, three hammers, three gimlets, two augers, ten sacks of nails
      and screws, three saws of various sizes, and two boxes of needles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Arms:</i> two flintlock guns, two percussion cap guns, two carbines
      with central ignition, five cutlasses, four sabers, two barrels of powder
      each containing 25 pounds, and twelve boxes of fulminate primers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Instruments:</i> one sextant, one pair of binoculars, one telescope,
      one box compass, one pocket compass, one Fahrenheit thermometer, one
      aneroid barometer, one box containing a complete photographic apparatus,
      objective, plates, chemicals, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Clothing:</i> two dozen shirts of a particular fiber resembling wool,
      but evidently of a vegetable origin and three dozen hose of the same
      fiber.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Utensils:</i> one iron pot, six galvanized copper saucepans, three
      iron plates, ten aluminum table settings, two kettles, one small portable
      stove and six table knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Books:</i> one bible containing the old and new testaments, one atlas,
      one dictionary of various Polynesian dialects, one dictionary on natural
      science in six volumes, three reams of blank paper and two record books
      of blank paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It must be admitted,” said the reporter, after the inventory was
      completed, “that the owner of this case was a practical man. Tools, arms,
      instruments, clothing, utensils, books, nothing is missing. One would say
      that he expected to be wrecked and that he prepared in advance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In fact, nothing is missing,” murmured Cyrus Smith thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it’s a sure bet,” added Herbert, “that the ship which brought this
      case and the owner were not Malayan pirates.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Unless,” said Pencroff, “the owner had been made a prisoner by the
      pirates...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is not admissible,” replied the reporter. “It is more likely that
      an American or European ship had been drawn into these waters and that
      the passengers, wanting to save some essential things at least, prepared
      this case and threw it into the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that your opinion, Mister Cyrus?” asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my child,” replied the engineer, “it may have happened in this way.
      It is possible that for a time they expected to be wrecked so they placed
      the most useful objects in this case in order to retrieve it at some
      point on the coast...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Even the photography box!” noted the sailor rather incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As to that apparatus,” replied Cyrus Smith, “I do not quite see its
      utility and a more complete assortment of clothing or more ammunition
      would be of better value to us as to other castaways.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But isn’t there some mark or address on these instruments, tools or
      books which will let us know who made them?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to be seen. Each item was carefully examined, especially the
      books, the instruments and the arms. Neither the arms nor the
      instruments, contrary to custom, carried the manufacturer’s mark; they
      were besides, in perfect condition and they seemed to have never been
      used. Especially the tools and utensils; everything was new, which
      proved, in short, that these items had not been taken at random and
      thrown into the case but, on the contrary, that the choice of these items
      had been made thoughtfully and their arrangement was made carefully. This
      was further indicted by this second envelope of metal which had protected
      it from the dampness and which could not have been soldered in a moment
      of haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian dialects, both
      were in English but they did not carry the editor’s name nor the date of
      publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the bible, printed in English in quarto was remarkable from a
      typographical point of view and appeared to have been thumbed through
      often.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the atlas, it was a magnificent work in French nomenclature,
      containing maps of the entire world and several planispheres based on
      Mercator projection—but it did not carry the date of publication nor the
      name of the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all these various items there was no indication as to the country
      of origin and nothing consequently to let them guess as to the
      nationality of the vessel which had so recently passed through these
      waters. But regardless of where it came from, it gave riches to the
      colonists of Lincoln Island. Until then, by transforming the products of
      nature, they had made everything by themselves, and thanks to their
      intelligence they had attended to their affairs. But did it not seem that
      Providence wished to reward them by bringing them these various products
      of human industry. Their thanks went unanimously to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one of them was not absolutely satisfied. It was Pencroff. It
      seemed that the case did not enclose the one thing he wanted enormously
      and as each of the items were taken out his hurrahs diminished in
      intensity and, with the inventory completed, one heard him murmur these
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is all good and well, but you can see that there is nothing for me
      in this box!”
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought Neb to say to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, friend Pencroff, what did you expect?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A half pound of tobacco,” Pencroff replied seriously, “and nothing would
      be lacking for my happiness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not help laughing at the sailor’s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as a result of the discovery of this case it was now more than ever
      necessary to make a serious exploration of the island. It was therefore
      agreed that the next day, at daybreak, they would get underway, ascend
      the Mercy in order to reach the western shore. If some castaways had
      landed on this part of the coast, it was to be feared that they were
      without resources and that help should be brought to them without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this day, the various items were carried to Granite House and
      methodically arranged in the large hall. This day—October 29th—was a
      Sunday and before going to bed Herbert asked the engineer if he would
      read to them some passage from the gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gladly,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the sacred book and was going to open it when Pencroff stopped
      him and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Cyrus, I am superstitious. Open at random and read to us the
      first verse that catches your eye. We will see if it applies to our
      situation.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>“Mister Cyrus, I am superstitious.”</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith smiled at the sailor’s idea and obliging he opened the gospel
      exactly where a ribbon separated the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his attention was fixed on a red cross which was made with a
      pencil and placed in front of Chapter VII, Verse 8 of the Gospel of Saint
      Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he read this verse as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      “For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.”
