      <b class="cap">There</b> was no longer any doubt about the pirates’
      intentions. They had thrown anchor a short distance from the island and
      it was evident that the next day, by means of their boats, they would
      come ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and his companions were ready to act but, determined as they
      were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their presence could
      still be concealed in the event that the pirates would be content to land
      on shore without venturing into the island’s interior. Their only purpose
      might be to draw fresh water from the Mercy and it was not impossible
      that the bridge, thrown a mile and a half from the mouth, and the
      arrangements at the Chimneys, would escape their notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why this flag flying from the truck of the brig’s mast? Why the
      firing of the cannon? Pure boasting doubtless, unless it indicated taking
      possession. Cyrus Smith now knew that the vessel was well armed. What did
      the colonists of Lincoln Island have to reply to the pirates’ cannon?
      Merely a few guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nevertheless,” Cyrus Smith noted, “we are in an impregnable position
      here. The enemy cannot discover the opening of the passageway now that it
      is hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it will be impossible
      for him to penetrate into Granite House.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But our plantations, our poultry yard, our corral, everything,” shouted
      Pencroff, stamping his foot. “They can ravage everything, destroy
      everything in a few hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Everything, Pencroff,” replied Cyrus Smith, “and we have no way to
      prevent it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are they numerous? That is the question,” the reporter then said. “If
      there are only a dozen or so we will know how to stop them, but forty,
      fifty, more perhaps...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mister Smith,” Ayrton then said, advancing toward the engineer, “will
      you grant me leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For what, my friend?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To go to the vessel to determine the size of her crew.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But Ayrton...” replied the engineer, hesitating, “you will risk your
      life...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not, sir?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is more than your duty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have more than my duty to do,” replied Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will go to the vessel with the canoe?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but I will swim. A man can glide between the waves while a canoe
      cannot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you realize that the brig is a mile and a quarter from shore?” said
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I swim well, Mister Herbert.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I tell you that you will risk your life,” the engineer repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My life is of no value,” replied Ayrton. “Mister Smith, I ask this of
      you as a favor. It is perhaps a way for me to gain respect for myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go, Ayrton,” replied the engineer, who sensed that a refusal would
      deeply hurt the former convict, who was now an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will accompany you,” said Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You mistrust me?” Ayrton replied vividly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then more humbly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no,” Cyrus Smith said, “no, Ayrton! Pencroff does not mistrust you.
      You misinterpret his words.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a matter of fact,” replied the sailor, “I propose to accompany Ayrton
      only to the islet. It is possible, though not probable, that one of these
      rascals has set foot there and in that case two men will not be too many
      for preventing him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the
      islet and he alone will go to the vessel since this is his wish.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This agreed, Ayrton made preparations for his departure. His plan was
      audacious but it could succeed thanks to the obscurity of the night. Once
      he reached the ship, Ayrton could catch on either to the bob-stays or to
      the shroud chains. He could determine their number and perhaps overhear
      the intentions of the convicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton and Pencroff, followed by their companions, descended to the
      beach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease so as to lessen
      the effect of the water’s temperature which was still cold. In fact, he
      might be obliged to remain in it for several hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Pencroff and Neb went to find the canoe, moored a few
      hundred feet higher up on the banks of the Mercy, and when they returned,
      Ayrton was ready to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cloak was thrown over Ayrton’s shoulders and the colonists came to
      clasp his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton got into the canoe with Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten thirty in the evening when the two disappeared into the
      darkness. Their companions went to the Chimneys to wait for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The channel was easily crossed and the canoe reached the opposite shore
      of the islet. This was done cautiously in case some pirates were prowling
      about. But it appeared that the islet was deserted. Ayrton, followed by
      Pencroff, quickly crossed it, scaring off some birds nested in the
      cavities in the rocks; then without hesitation, he threw himself into the
      water and swam noiselessly in the direction of the vessel, whose recently
      lit lights indicated its exact position.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Pencroff, he crouched behind a twist in the shoreline and waited
      for his companion’s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton swam with a vigorous stroke and glided across the sheet of water
      without producing the slightest quiver. His head barely emerged and his
      eyes were fixed on the dark mass of the brig whose lights were reflected
      in the water. He thought only of the task that he had promised to
      accomplish. He did not even consider the dangers that he ran not only on
      board the vessel but also in the waters which were often frequented by
      sharks. The current carried him and he rapidly moved away from the shore.
    </p>

        <b>He took a breath and climbed the chains...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A half-hour later Ayrton, without having been seen or heard, drew
      alongside the vessel and caught on to the bob-stays of the bowsprit. He
      took a breath, climbed the chains and reached the top of the cutwater.
      There several sailors’ trousers were drying. He put on a pair. Then,
      settling down, he listened.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/614.jpg" border="1" width="322" height="459" alt=

        <b>Settling down, Ayrton listened.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      No one was asleep on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking,
      singing and laughing. And this is the talk, accompanied by oaths,
      overheard by Ayrton:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our brig is a fine prize!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The <i>Speedy</i> sails well. It merits its name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It can outdistance the entire navy of Norfolk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah for its commander.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah for Bob Harvey.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We can understand how Ayrton felt on hearing this fragment of
      conversation, when we realize that Bob Harvey was one of his former
      companions in Australia, an audacious sailor who had continued with his
      criminal activities. In the waters around Norfolk Island, Bob Harvey had
      seized this brig which was loaded with arms, munitions, utensils and
      tools of all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. His entire
      gang went on board and, becoming pirates after having been convicts, they
      scoured the Pacific, destroying vessels and massacring their crews with
      more ferocity than the Malays themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convicts shouted and boasted about their deeds while drinking to
      excess and this is what Ayrton discovered:
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual crew of the <i>Speedy</i> was composed solely of English
      prisoners who had escaped from Norfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this is what Norfolk is:
    </p>
    <p>
      At 29° 2′ south latitude and 167° 57′ east longitude, to the east of
      Australia, there is a small island six leagues in circumference which is
      dominated by Mount Pitt, rising to a height of eleven hundred feet above
      sea level. This is Norfolk Island, turned into an establishment for the
      jailing of the most intractable convicts of the English penitentiaries.
      There are five hundred of them, subject to an iron discipline and
      terrible punishments, and guarded by one hundred fifty soldiers and one
      hundred fifty employees under the orders of a governor. It would be
      difficult to imagine a worse group of criminals. Sometimes—though this is
      rare—in spite of the excessive surveillance to which they are subject,
      some escape, seize vessels by surprise, and then scour the Polynesian
      Archipelagoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were Bob Harvey and his companions. Such had Ayrton once wished to
      be. Bob Harvey had seized the <i>Speedy</i>, anchored in sight of Norfolk
      Island; the crew had been massacred and for a year now this vessel, now a
      pirate ship, had scoured the Pacific seas under the command of Harvey,
      formerly a master mariner, now a pirate of the seas and well known to
      Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convicts were for the most part gathered on the poop deck to the rear
      of the vessel but a few were stretched out on the bridge, shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation continued amidst shouting and drinking. Ayrton learned
      that chance alone had brought the <i>Speedy</i> within sight of Lincoln
      Island. Bob Harvey had never set foot on it but, as Cyrus Smith had
      feared, finding himself near an unknown land, unmarked on any map, he
      thought of visiting it, and if suitable, he would make it the brig’s home
      port.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the black flag unfurled from the truck of the <i>Speedy</i>’s mast
      and the firing of the cannon, that was pure bragging on the part of the
      pirates, following the example of warships when they lower their colors.
      It was not a signal and no communication existed between Lincoln Island
      and the escapees of Norfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domain of the colonists was menaced by an immense danger. Evidently
      the island, with its easy access to fresh water, its small port, its
      resources of all sorts so increased in value by the colonists, and the
      hidden retreats of Granite House, would be suitable for the convicts; in
      their hands it would become an excellent place of refuge and because it
      was unknown, it would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity with
      security. It was also evident that the colonists’ lives would not be
      respected and that the first concern of Bob Harvey and his companions
      would be to massacre them without mercy. Cyrus Smith and his men did not
      even have the option of fleeing and hiding themselves on the island since
      the convicts intended to live there and in the event that the
      <i>Speedy</i> would leave on an expedition, it was probable that some of
      the crew would remain on land in order to look after things. Thus they
      must fight them and destroy them to the last man. They deserved no pity
      and any methods used against them would be justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were Ayrton’s thoughts and he well knew that Cyrus Smith shared his
      viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was resistance and victory in the end possible? That depended on the
      brig’s armament and the number of men that she carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this that Ayrton resolved to determine at any cost, and since an
      hour after his arrival things began to quiet down and a good number of
      the convicts were already in a drunken stupor, Ayrton did not hesitate to
      venture onto the deck of the <i>Speedy</i> which the extinct lanterns
      then left in deep darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoisted himself on the cutwater and by the bowsprit he reached the
      brig’s forecastle. He glided among the convicts stretched out here and
      there. He made a tour of the ship and discovered that the <i>Speedy</i>
      was armed with four cannons which could fire balls of eight to ten
      pounds. By touching them he even verified that these cannons were breech
      loaders. Thus they were modern weapons, easy to use and terrible in
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the men lying about the deck, they numbered about ten but it was to
      be supposed that others, more numerous, were sleeping inside the brig.
      Besides, on listening to them, Ayrton was led to believe that there were
      about fifty on board. That was a lot for the six colonists of Lincoln
      Island. But thanks to Ayrton’s devotion, Cyrus Smith would not be
      surprised. He would know the strength of his adversaries and make
      arrangements in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now remained for Ayrton to return to render an account to his
      companions of the mission with which he was charged and he prepared to go
      to the forward part of the brig in order to glide down to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as he had said, he wanted to do more than his duty, and an heroic
      idea then came to him. It was to sacrifice his life, but he would save
      the island and the colonists. Cyrus Smith evidently could not resist
      fifty bandits armed with all kinds of weapons who, whether they
      penetrated Granite House by force or starved out the besieged, would
      overcome them. And then he thought of his saviors, those who had remade
      him into a man and an honest man at that, those to whom he owed
      everything, they being killed without pity, their work utterly destroyed,
      their island changed into a pirate’s retreat! He told himself that he,
      Ayrton, was the original cause of these disasters since otherwise his old
      companion, Bob Harvey, would not have realized his very own plans. A
      sentiment of horror then took hold of his entire being and he was seized
      by an irresistible desire to blow up the brig, himself and all those that
      it carried. Ayrton would perish in the explosion but he would have done
      his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton did not hesitate. It was easy to reach the powder room which is
      always situated to the rear of a ship. There would be no lack of powder
      on a vessel made for this business, and a spark would suffice to
      annihilate it in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton carefully slid down between decks where numerous sleepers were
      strewn about, weighed down more from drunkenness than slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lighted lantern at the foot of the grand mast around which
      was suspended a rack furnished with firearms of all sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton took a revolver from the rack and assured himself that it was
      loaded and primed. He needed nothing more to accomplish his work of
      destruction. He then glided to the rear so as to arrive under the poop
      deck where the storeroom ought to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, on this between decks level, which was rather dark, it was
      difficult to move about without jostling some convict not fully asleep.
      Between oaths and jabs, Ayrton was more than once forced to suspend his
      advance. But finally he reached the partition that enclosed the rear
      compartment and he found the door that would open into the very
      storeroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton was reduced to forcing it and set about the task. It was difficult
      to accomplish this without noise because he had to break a padlock. But
      under Ayrton’s vigorous hand the padlock was sprung and the door was
      opened...
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Ayrton felt an arm on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you doing here?” asked a tall man in a harsh voice who,
      standing in the shadows, projected the light of a lantern onto Ayrton’s
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton drew back. In a quick glare from the lantern, he recognized his
      former accomplice, Bob Harvey, but he could not have been recognized by
      him, believing him to be long since dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you doing here?” said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the belt of
      his trousers.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">

        <b>“What are you doing here?” said Bob Harvey.</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      But without replying, Ayrton shoved the pirate chief back and tried to
      get into the storeroom. One shot of the revolver into these tons of
      powder and all would be over!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Help, lads!” shouted Bob Harvey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three pirates, awakened by his voice, threw themselves on Ayrton,
      trying to bring him down. Ayrton shook them off. Two shots from his
      revolver resounded and two convicts fell; but a knife stab that he could
      not parry cut a gash on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayrton realized that he could not carry through his plan. Bob Harvey had
      locked the door of the storeroom and Ayrton sensed that everyone on board
      was awakening. It was necessary for Ayrton to save himself to fight by
      Cyrus Smith’s side. There remained nothing for him to do but to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was escape still possible? That was uncertain but Ayrton intended to
      do everything to rejoin his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still had four shots left. Two were fired, one of which was directed
      at Bob Harvey. It did not hit him, at least not seriously. His
      adversaries drew back and Ayrton profited from this movement by running
      toward the ladder leading up to the deck of the brig. Passing in front of
      a lantern he broke it with the butt of his revolver. The resulting
      darkness favored his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three pirates, aroused by the noise, were coming down the ladder
      at this moment. A fifth shot from Ayrton’s revolver threw one down and
      the others drew back, not understanding what was going on. In two leaps
      Ayrton was on the deck of the brig and three seconds later, after having
      discharged his revolver for the last time into the face of a pirate who
      was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the bulwarks and
      plunged into the sea.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        <b>He leaped over the bulwarks and plunged...</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Ayrton had not made six strokes when shot was crackling all around him
      like a hailstorm.
    </p>
    <p>
      What must have been the emotions of Pencroff, sheltered beneath a rock on
      the islet, and those of Cyrus Smith, of the reporter, of Herbert and of
      Neb huddled at the Chimneys, when they heard these detonations on board
      the brig. They ran to shore and, with their weapons to their shoulders,
      were ready to repel any attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt for them. Surprised by the pirates, Ayrton had been
      massacred by them and perhaps these wretches would profit by the night to
      descend on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half hour passed in extreme apprehension. The detonations however had
      ceased and neither Ayrton nor Pencroff had reappeared. Had the islet been
      invaded? Should they run to bring help to Ayrton and to Pencroff? But
      how? The tide, being high at the moment, made it impossible to cross the
      channel. The canoe was no longer there. One can imagine the terrible
      uneasiness which took hold of Cyrus Smith and his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, about a half hour past midnight, a canoe carrying two men drew
      alongside the shore. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and
      Pencroff, safe and sound, whom their companions received with open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton related
      what had occurred, not hiding his plan to blow up the brig which he had
      tried to put into execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands were held out to Ayrton who did not conceal how serious the
      situation was. The pirates had been forewarned. They knew that Lincoln
      Island was inhabited. They would descend en masse and well armed. They
      respected nothing. If the colonists fell into their hands, no pity would
      await them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, we will know how to die,” said the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us return to our posts and keep on guard,” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do we have some chance of pulling through, Mister Cyrus?” asked the
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Pencroff.”
