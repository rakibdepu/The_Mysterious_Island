      <b class="cap">Cyrus Smith</b> and his companions slept like innocent
      marmots in the cavern which the jaguar had so politely left at their
      disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunrise all were on the shore at the very extremity of the promontory,
      looking toward the horizon which was visible for two thirds of its
      circumference. For one last time the engineer could confirm that no sail,
      no remains of a vessel appeared on the sea, and the telescope did not
      show anything suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither was there anything on the shore, at least on the straight part
      that formed the southern coastline of the promontory for a distance of
      three miles, because beyond, an indentation of land concealed the
      remainder of the shore and even at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula
      they could not see Cape Claw, hidden by high rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the southern shore of the island remained to be explored.
      Now, should they try to undertake this exploration immediately and devote
      this day of November 1st to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not in their original plan. In fact when the canoe was abandoned
      at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after having
      observed the western coast, they would return to it and go back to
      Granite House via the Mercy. At the time Cyrus Smith believed that the
      western shore could offer a refuge either to boat in distress or to a
      vessel on its regular course; but from the moment that the coast showed
      no landing place, it became necessary to search the south of the island
      to find there what they had not been able to find in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Gideon Spilett who proposed to continue the exploration so that
      the question of the presumed wreck could be completely resolved. He asked
      at what distance Cape Claw could be from the extremity of the peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      “About thirty miles,” replied the engineer, “if we take into account the
      curvature of the coast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thirty miles!” replied Gideon Spilett. “That will be a good day’s march.
      Nevertheless I think that we should return to Granite House by the
      southern shore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But,” noted Herbert, “it is at least another ten miles from Cape Claw to
      Granite House.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Make it forty miles in all,” replied the reporter, “and let us not
      hesitate to do it. At least we will have observed this unknown coast and
      we will not have to undertake this exploration again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quite right,” Pencroff then said. “But the canoe?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The canoe has remained alone for one day at the sources of the Mercy,”
      replied Gideon Spilett. “It can stay there just as well for two days. For
      the moment we can hardly say that the island is infested with thieves.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “However,” said the sailor, “when I recall the story of the tortoise, I
      no longer have that confidence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The tortoise! The tortoise!” replied the reporter. “Don’t you know that
      it was the sea that turned it over?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who knows?” murmured the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But...” said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Neb had something to say because he opened his mouth
      to speak but nothing came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What did you want to say, Neb?” the engineer asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If we return via the shore to Cape Claw,” replied Neb, “after having
      doubled the cape, we will be stopped...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “By the Mercy!” replied Herbert, “and in fact, we will have neither a
      bridge nor a boat with which to cross it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine, Mister Cyrus,” replied Pencroff, “with a few floating trunks we
      will not be inconvenienced in crossing the river.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s not important,” said Gideon Spilett, “it will be useful to
      construct a bridge if we want to have easy access to the Far West.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A bridge!” cried Pencroff. “Well, isn’t Mister Smith the best engineer
      in his profession? But he will make us a bridge when we want to have a
      bridge. As to transporting you this evening to the other side of the
      Mercy without wetting a stitch of your clothing, I’ll be responsible for
      that. We still have a day’s provisions and that is all that we need and
      besides, we may have more game today than we had yesterday. Let’s go!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter’s proposition, very vividly supported by the sailor, gained
      general approval because everyone wanted to settle his doubts and by
      returning via Cape Claw, the exploration would be complete. But there
      wasn’t an hour to lose because forty miles was a long trip and they could
      not count on reaching Granite House before night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o’clock in the morning the small troop was on its way. As a
      precaution against any undesirable encounters with animals on two or four
      feet, the guns were loaded with ball and Top, who was in the lead, was
      ordered to scour the edge of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the
      peninsula, the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which was
      rapidly crossed without the most minute investigations having shown the
      least trace of a landing either in the past or recently, neither a wreck
      nor the remainder of an encampment nor the cinders of an extinct fire nor
      a footprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists arrived at the corner where the curvature of the coast
      ended. They were then able to extend their view to the northeast over
      Washington Bay and over the entire extent of the southern shore of the
      island. Twenty five miles away the coast ended at Cape Claw which was
      slightly blurred by the morning fog. A mirage made it seem suspended
      between land and sea. Between the spot occupied by the colonists and the
      beginning of the immense bay, the shore was composed of a very smooth and
      flat beach bordered by trees. Further along, the shore became very
      irregular with sharp points projecting into the sea, and finally several
      blackish rocks were piled up in picturesque disorder ending at Cape Claw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the development of this part of the island that the explorers
      saw for the first time. They quickly surveyed it after having stopped for
      a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A vessel that would put in here,” Pencroff said, “would inevitably be
      lost. This beach of sand extends up to the sea and the reefs beyond!
      Dangerous waters!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But a least something of this vessel would remain,” the reporter noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Some pieces of wood would remain on the reefs but nothing on the sand,”
      replied the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why so?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because the sand is even more dangerous than the rocks, engulfing
      everything that is thrown upon it and only a few days would be needed for
      the hull of a vessel of several hundred tons to disappear there
      entirely!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So, Pencroff,” asked the engineer, “if a vessel ran aground on these
      banks, it is not astonishing that there is no longer any trace of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Mister Smith, with the aid of time or tempest. Still, it would be
      surprising, even in this case, if some debris of the masts and spars were
      not thrown on the bank beyond the reach of the sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us then continue our search,” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after noon the colonists arrived at the beginning of Washington
      Bay and at this time they had covered a distance of twenty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      They halted for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the coast became bizarrely irregular and was covered by a long line
      of reefs behind which were banks of sand. The tide was low at the moment
      but would not be long in covering it. They saw the supple waves of the
      sea breaking against the tops of rocks, and then turning into long foam
      fringes. From this point up to Cape Claw, there was little space for the
      beach which was confined between the edge of reefs and that of the
      forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trip thus became more difficult because of the innumerable rocks
      which encumbered the shore. The granite wall also tended to become higher
      as they went on and they could see only the green tops of trees that
      crowned it, not disturbed by any wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      After resting for a half hour, the colonists again took to the road and
      no point on the reefs or beach escaped their attention. Pencroff and Neb
      even ventured among the reefs anytime some object attracted their
      attention. But there was no wreck and they were misled by some bizarre
      shape of rocks. They did note however, that edible shellfish abounded in
      these waters but they could not profitably exploit this until
      communication would be established between the two banks of the Mercy and
      also when the means of transport would be perfected.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no indication of the presumed wreck on this shore
      notwithstanding that fact that the hull of a vessel was an object of some
      importance and should have been visible. Some of the debris should have
      carried to shore, as had the case found at least twenty miles further on,
      but there was nothing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o’clock, Cyrus Smith and his companions arrived at a narrow,
      well enclosed inlet which was not associated with a watercourse. It
      formed a real small natural port, invisible from the sea, which could be
      reached by a narrow passage between the reefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the rear of this inlet some violent convulsion had torn up the rocky
      shore and an excavation on a gentle slope gave access to the upper
      plateau. This was situated at least ten miles from Cape Claw and
      consequently four miles in a straight line from Grand View Plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett proposed to his companions that they halt here. They
      accepted because the trip had sharpened everyone’s appetite and, though
      it was not dinner time, no one could refuse a piece of venison. This meal
      would permit them to wait for supper at Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, the colonists were seated at the foot of a
      magnificent cluster of maritime pines, devouring the food that Neb had
      taken from his knapsack.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spot was fifty or sixty feet above the level of the sea. The radius
      of their view was rather extended, passing over the last rocks of the
      cape and into Union Bay. But neither the islet nor Grand View Plateau was
      visible, nor could it be from that position because the level of the
      ground and the screen of trees abruptly masked the northern horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say, in spite of the expanse of sea that could be seen by the
      explorers, and as much as the engineer’s telescope swept from point to
      point across this entire circle on which the sky and water blended, no
      vessel was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise on all this part of the shore that still remained for
      exploration, the telescope swept with the same care from the beach to the
      reefs, but no wreck appeared within the field of view of the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come,” said Gideon Spilett, “we must resign ourselves to the inevitable
      and take comfort in the thought that no one will come to dispute our
      possession of Lincoln Island.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what about the lead bullet!” said Herbert. “It still wasn’t
      imagined, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand devils, no!” cried Pencroff, thinking of his missing molar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what can we conclude?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This,” replied the engineer, “that in the last three months at most, a
      vessel, voluntarily or not, landed...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What! You admit, Cyrus, that it was engulfed without leaving any trace?”
      cried the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my dear Spilett, but note that it is certain that a human being has
      set foot on this island and it appears none the less certain that he has
      now left it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then if I understand you, Mister Cyrus,” said Herbert, “the vessel went
      away?...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Evidently.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And we have lost a chance to leave?” said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Past all hope, I’m afraid.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well! Since the chance is lost, let us be on our way,” said Pencroff,
      who was already homesick for Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hardly had he gotten up when Top came out of the woods barking loudly
      and holding in his mouth a scrap of cloth soiled with mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb tore this scrap from the dog’s mouth. It was a piece of strong cloth.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/360.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>It was a piece of strong cloth.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      Top continued to bark and by his coming and going he seemed to invite his
      master to follow him into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here is something which may explain my lead bullet!” cried Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A castaway” replied Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wounded perhaps!” said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Or dead!” replied the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And everyone followed the dog among the large pines which formed the
      first screen of the forest. Cyrus Smith and his companions loaded their
      guns for any eventuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had to advance rather deeply into the woods but to their great
      disappointment, they still did not see any footprints. Brushwood and
      creepers were intact and it was even necessary to cut them with the axe
      as they had done in the thickest part of the forest. It was thus
      difficult to admit that a human creature had already passed there. Still
      Top came and went, not as a dog who searched at random, but as a being
      endowed with a will, who is following up an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      After seven or eight minutes, Top stopped. The colonists arrived at a
      sort of clearing bordered by large trees. They looked around but saw
      nothing either under the brushwood or among the tree trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what is it, Top?” asked Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top barked louder jumping to the foot of a gigantic tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Pencroff cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! Fine! Ah! Perfect!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is it?” asked Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are looking for a wreck on sea or on land!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, it is to be found in the sky!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sailor pointed to a sort of huge white cloth hanging on to the
      top of a pine, of which Top had brought a piece that had fallen to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But this is not a wreck,” cried Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg your pardon!” replied Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed. It is...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is all that remains of our aerial boat, of our balloon which is
      stranded up there at the top of this tree.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff was not mistaken and he let out a magnificent hurrah and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is good cloth! It will furnish us with linen for years. With this
      we can make handkerchiefs and shirts! Hey! Mister Spilett, what do you
      think of an island where shirts grow on trees?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was truly a happy circumstance for the colonists of Lincoln Island
      that the balloon, after having made its last leap into the sky, fell back
      again on the island, and that they had this chance to find it. Either
      they could keep the envelope in its present form if they wanted to
      attempt another escape by air, or they could profitably use these several
      hundred yards of cotton cloth of good quality, after removing the
      varnish. Pencroff’s joy in thinking about this was unanimously and
      vividly shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was necessary to take this envelope from the tree on which it was
      hanging, to put it in a secure place, and this was no small job. Neb,
      Herbert and the sailor, having climbed to the top of the tree, had to use
      all their dexterity to disengage the enormous deflated balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operation lasted nearly two hours and not only the envelope with its
      valves, its springs, its copper trimmings, but the rope, that is to say
      the considerable cordage, the retaining ring and the anchor of the
      balloon were brought down. The envelope, except for the fracture, was in
      good condition, and only its lower portion was torn.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/363.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>The operation lasted nearly two hours.</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      It was a fortune that had fallen from the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All the same, Mister Cyrus,” said the sailor, “if we ever decide to
      leave the island, it will not be in a balloon, will it? They do not go
      where one wants, these vessels of the sky, and we know something about
      that! Take my word, we will build a good boat of about twenty tons and
      you’ll allow me to cut a foresail and a jib out of this cloth. As to the
      rest, it will serve to clothe us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will see, Pencroff,” replied Cyrus Smith, “we will see.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “While waiting, we must put it all in a safe place,” said Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, they could not think of transporting this load of cloth and
      cordage, whose weight was considerable, to Granite House. While waiting
      for a convenient vehicle to cart it, it was important not to leave these
      riches any longer to the mercy of the first storm. The colonists, uniting
      their efforts, succeeded in dragging everything to the shore where they
      discovered a rather large rocky cavern which would be visited neither by
      the wind nor the rain nor the sea thanks to its orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is proper to have a wardrobe. We have a wardrobe,” said Pencroff,
      “but since it does not close with a key, it would be prudent to conceal
      the opening. I do not say this for two footed thieves but for thieves on
      four feet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o’clock in the evening all was stored. After having given the
      justified name of “Port Balloon” to this small indentation which formed
      the cove, they were back on the road to Cape Claw. Pencroff and the
      engineer chatted about various projects which it would be convenient to
      put into execution with the briefest delay. Before anything else, it was
      necessary to throw a bridge over the Mercy in order to establish easy
      communication with the south of the island; then the cart would come back
      to look for the balloon since the canoe would not suffice to transport
      it; then they would construct a decked boat, then, Pencroff rigging it as
      a cutter, they could undertake some voyages around the island, then, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, night came on and the sky was already dark when the colonists
      reached Cape Claw in the very same place where they had discovered the
      precious case. But there, as everywhere else, there was nothing to
      indicate any wreck whatsoever. They had to go back to the conclusion
      previously made by Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Cape Claw to Granite House there still remained four miles which
      were rapidly crossed. It was after midnight when, after having followed
      the shore up to the mouth of the Mercy, the colonists arrived at the
      first bend formed by the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the bed measured eighty feet in width and it was a difficult
      crossing but Pencroff, having made himself responsible for overcoming
      this difficulty, could not change his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had to admit that they were exhausted. The day’s march had been a
      long one and the incident of the balloon had not rested their arms and
      their legs. They were therefore in a hurry to get back to Granite House,
      to eat and to sleep and if a bridge had been constructed they would have
      found themselves in their dwelling in a quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very dark. Pencroff then prepared to keep his promise by making a
      sort of raft that could cross the Mercy. Neb and he, armed with axes,
      chose two trees near the bank with which they counted on making the raft.
      They began to chop away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett, seated on the bank, were waiting for the
      time when they could help their companions, while Herbert came and went
      without digressing far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the lad, who had ascended the river, came running back and
      pointing upstream:
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that floating there?” he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff interrupted his work and vaguely saw a moving object in the
      shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A canoe!” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      All approached and saw, to their extreme surprise, a boat moving in the
      stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! A canoe!” cried the sailor in a lapse of caution, without thinking
      if it would perhaps be better to keep silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer. The boat still drifted. It was not more than a dozen feet away
      when the sailor cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But it is our canoe! It broke its mooring and followed the current. It
      certainly arrived in the nick of time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our canoe?...” murmured the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff was right. It really was the canoe, whose mooring had doubtless
      broken and which had returned all alone from the sources of the Mercy. It
      was thus important to seize it before it was dragged beyond the mouth by
      the rapid current of the river. That is what Neb and Pencroff skillfully
      did by means of a long pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe was brought to the shore. The engineer, being the first to
      embark, seized the mooring and assured himself, by fingering it, that the
      mooring had really worn away by rubbing against the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is what can be called a circumstance...,” the reporter said to him
      in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Strange!” replied Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange or not, it was fortunate. Herbert, the reporter, Neb and Pencroff
      embarked in their turn. There was no doubt that the mooring had worn
      away, but the most astonishing thing about the affair truly was that the
      canoe had arrived just at the moment when the colonists could seize it in
      passing, because a quarter of an hour later it would have been lost at
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they had lived in the time of genies, this incident would have given
      them the right to think that the island was haunted by a supernatural
      being who placed his power at the service of the castaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few strokes of the oar brought the colonists to the mouth of the Mercy.
      The canoe was towed to the beach at the Chimneys and everyone went toward
      the ladder of Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment Top barked in anger and Neb, who was looking for the
      first rung, let out a cry...
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladder was no longer there.
