      <b class="cap">The</b> engineer was carried off by a wave through the
      mesh of rope which had given way. His dog had also disappeared. The
      faithful animal had voluntarily thrown himself in to help his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forward!” shouted the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all four, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroff and Neb, forgetting their
      exhaustion and fatigue, began their search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Neb cried with rage and despair at the same time at the thought of
      having lost all that he loved in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes had not passed from the moment when Cyrus Smith had
      disappeared to the instant when his companions touched land. They could
      therefore hope to arrive in time to save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us search! Let us search!” shouted Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Neb,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and we will find him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Living?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Living!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does he know how to swim?” asked Pencroff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Neb, “and besides, Top is there...”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor, listening to the sea roar, shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the coast to the north, about a half mile from the spot where
      the castaways had landed, that the engineer had disappeared. If he could
      reach the nearest point on the shoreline he would be at most a half mile
      from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then nearly six o’clock. A fog came on making the night very
      obscure. The castaways proceeded northward on the eastern coastline of
      this land upon which chance had thrown them, an unknown land whose
      geographical location they could not even guess at. They trampled on
      sandy soil, mixed with stones, which seemed to be deprived of every
      species of vegetation. This soil, very uneven and rugged, seemed in
      certain spots to be riddled with small potholes which made their progress
      very painful. From these holes, heavy birds of sluggish flight escaped at
      each instant, flying off in all directions into the obscurity. Other more
      agile ones rose and passed overhead in flocks like clouds. The sailor
      thought he recognized sea gulls and sea mews whose sharp cries contended
      with the roars from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time the castaways stopped to shout and listen for some
      sound not made by the ocean. It was possible that if they were near the
      place where the engineer had landed they might hear Top’s barking in case
      Cyrus Smith was unable to give some sign of his existence. But no cry was
      heard above the roar of the waves and the clash of the surf. Then the
      small troop resumed their forward march and searched every crevice of the
      shoreline.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a walk of twenty minutes the four castaways were suddenly stopped
      by the foaming waves. Solid ground vanished. They found themselves at the
      extremity of a sharp point against which the sea broke with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a promontory,” said the sailor. “We must retrace our steps keeping
      to our right and in this way we will get to the mainland.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what if he is there!” replied Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose
      enormous waves whitened the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then let us call him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      And they all shouted together vigorously but there was no response. They
      waited for a lull. They shouted again. Again nothing.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/026.jpg" width="100%"></img>
      <b>And they all shouted together...</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      The castaways then went back on the opposite side of the promontory on
      soil just as sandy and rocky. However Pencroff noted that this shoreline
      was more abrupt, and the ground more elevated and he assumed that it was
      joined by an elongated ramp to a high coast that he could barely make
      out. The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore. The sea also
      surged less here and was less noisy. It was also remarkable that there
      was less agitation in the waves. They could barely hear the noise of the
      surf. Doubtless this side of the promontory formed a semi-circular cove
      with a sharp point that protected it from the waves of the open sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in going in this direction they were moving toward the south away
      from that part of the coast where Cyrus Smith might have set foot. For a
      mile and a half the shoreline did not present any turn that would permit
      them to head north again. Though they had turned the point, the
      promontory should be connected to the mainland. In spite of their
      exhaustion the castaways continued to move forward courageously hoping at
      each moment to find a sharp turn that would put them back in the original
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine their disappointment when, after about two miles, they found
      themselves once again stopped by the sea on a somewhat elevated group of
      slippery rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are on an islet,” said Pencroff, “and we have surveyed it from one
      extremity to the other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor’s observation was justified. The castaways had been thrown not
      on a continent, not even on an island, but on an islet that did not
      measure more than two miles in length and whose width was evidently
      considerably less.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was this barren islet, scattered with rocks, without vegetation, this
      desolate refuge for several sea birds, was it part of an important
      archipelago? They could not say. When the balloon passengers were in the
      basket they could see land only indistinctly through the fog. They were
      not able to judge its size. However, Pencroff, whose sailor’s eyes were
      accustomed to pierce the haze, believed that he could distinguish
      confused masses in the west which would signify an elevated coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, because of the obscurity, they could not determine if the islet
      had a simple or a complex appearance. They could not even leave it
      because the sea surrounded it. They must put off until the next day the
      search for the engineer who alas had not signaled his presence by any
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The silence of Cyrus proves nothing,” said the reporter. “He may have
      fainted or be injured and momentarily in no condition to respond, but let
      us not despair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter then got the idea of lighting a fire at the point of the
      islet to serve as a signal to the engineer. They looked in vain for dry
      wood or brushwood. Sand and stones, there was nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can understand the grief of Neb and his companions who were keenly
      attached to this intrepid Cyrus Smith. It was quite evident that they
      were powerless to help him. They must await the day. Either the engineer
      had been able to save himself and had already found refuge at some point
      on the coast, or he was lost forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      These were long and painful hours to pass. The cold was sharp. The
      castaways suffered cruelly but they scarcely felt it. It did not occur to
      them to rest for a moment. Forgetting themselves for their chief, hoping,
      always wanting to hope, they went back and forth on the barren islet,
      always coming back to its north point, closest to the place of the
      catastrophe. They listened, they shouted, they tried to detect some
      supreme call. Their voices should have carried far because a certain calm
      then prevailed in the atmosphere and the noise of the sea began to fall
      with the billows.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Neb’s cries even seemed, for a moment, to produce an echo. Herbert
      brought this to Pencroff’s attention, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      “This proves that there is a shoreline not too far to the west.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor made an affirmative sign. Besides, his eyes could not deceive
      him. If he had distinguished land however faintly, it was because land
      was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this remote echo was the only response provoked by Neb’s cries and
      all else on the east part of the islet remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, little by little the sky cleared. Toward midnight some stars
      were shining and if the engineer had been there near his companions he
      would have remarked that these stars were no longer those of the northern
      hemisphere. In fact the pole star did not appear above this new horizon
      and the polar constellations were no longer those usually observed in
      North America. It was the Southern Cross which was shining at the south
      pole of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed. About five o’clock in the morning, the 25th of March,
      the higher levels of the atmosphere changed slightly. The horizon was
      still dark but with the first light of day an opaque fog rose from the
      sea so that visibility did not extend more than about twenty feet. The
      fog spread out in large volutes that moved clumsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a disappointment. The castaways could not distinguish anything
      around them. While Neb and the reporter looked toward the ocean, the
      sailor and Herbert looked for a coastline in the west but not a bit of
      land was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No matter,” said Pencroff, “if I do not see the coastline, I can feel
      it... It is there... there... just as surely as we are no longer in
      Richmond.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But the haze was not long in lifting. It was nothing but a fine weather
      haze. A good sun warmed the upper layers and this heat sifted to the
      surface of the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact about half past six, three quarters of an hour after sunrise, the
      fog became more transparent. It persisted above but dissipated below.
      Soon the entire islet appeared as if it had descended from a cloud. The
      sea showed itself in a circular form, infinite in the east but bounded by
      an elevated and abrupt coast in the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! Land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally assured.
      Between the islet and the coast, separated by an open channel a half mile
      in width, ran a noisy rapid current.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one of the castaways, consulting only his heart, immediately
      threw himself into the current, without asking the opinions of his
      companions and without even saying a single word. It was Neb. He was in a
      hurry to be on this coast and to rush northward. No one could hold him
      back. Pencroff called to him but in vain. The reporter was inclined to
      follow Neb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff then went to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you want to cross this channel?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well then listen, believe me,” said the sailor, “Neb is well able to
      bring help to his master. If we throw ourselves into this channel we will
      risk being carried to the open sea by an extremely violent current. Now,
      if I am not mistaken, it is an ebbing current. See the sea is going down
      on the beach. Let us have patience and at low tide it is possible that we
      will find a fordable passage...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are right,” replied the reporter. “Let us not separate any more than
      we have to...”
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Neb was vigorously struggling against the current. He
      crossed it in an oblique direction. They saw his black shoulders emerge
      at each stroke. He was swept on at an extreme speed but he also got
      closer to the shore. It took him a half hour to cross the half mile that
      separated the islet from the mainland. He reached the opposite shore
      several thousand feet downstream from the point on the islet where he
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb set foot at the base of a high granite wall and shook himself
      vigorously, then running he soon disappeared behind a point of rocks that
      projected into the sea at about the same distance as the northern
      extremity of the islet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neb’s companions anxiously followed his daring endeavor. When he was out
      of sight they turned their attention to this land on which they would be
      taking refuge, while eating some shellfish which were scattered on the
      sand. It was a meager repast but it was something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposite coast formed a vast bay, terminated in the south by a very
      sharp point which was devoid of all vegetation and of a very savage
      aspect. This point was joined to the shore by a rather capricious pattern
      and was braced up against high granite rocks. Toward the north, on the
      other hand, a wide bay formed a more rounded coast, running from
      southwest to northeast and ending with a sharp cape. Between these two
      extreme points of the bay’s arc the distance was perhaps eight miles. A
      half mile from shore the islet occupied a narrow strip of the sea
      resembling an enormous cetacean whose body it represented on a large
      scale. Its largest width was not more than a quarter of a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the island, the shore in the foreground was composed of sand
      scattered with blackish rocks which, at the moment, were reappearing
      little by little with the ebbing tide. Behind that was a sort of smooth
      granite facade crowned by a capricious ridge at a height of three hundred
      feet. It ran thus for a length of three miles and ended abruptly at the
      right with a slanted corner that one would think was made by the hand of
      man. On the left, on the other hand, beyond the promontory, this sort of
      irregular cliff broke into prismatic fragments made of a conglomerate of
      rocks, sloping downward by an elongated ramp which gradually blended with
      the rocks at the southern point.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not one tree on the upper plateau of the coast. It was a flat
      plateau like the one which overlooks Capetown at the Cape of Good Hope
      but with much reduced proportions. At least so it appeared as seen from
      the islet. Nevertheless, vegetation was not lacking to the right, behind
      the slanted corner. They could easily distinguish a confused mass of
      large trees to the limit of their view. This verdure gladdened eyes
      saddened by the lines of the granite face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, to the rear beyond the plateau in a northwesterly direction and
      at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white peak reflecting
      the sun’s rays. It was a hat of snow capping some distant mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not say if the land formed an island or if it was part of a
      continent. But looking at the convulsed rocks piled up on the left, a
      geologist would have not hesitated to give them a volcanic origin,
      because they were incontestably the result of plutonic activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon Spilett, Pencroff and Herbert carefully observed this land on
      which they would perhaps spend many long years, even die on it if they
      were not on the ship lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” asked Herbert, “what do you say, Pencroff?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” replied the sailor, “there is good here and bad as in everything.
      We will see. But now the ebb is being felt. In three hours we will try to
      cross and once there we will try to organize ourselves to search for
      Mister Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff was not wrong in his prediction. Three hours later, at low tide,
      most of the sand that formed the bed of the canal was uncovered. Between
      the shore and the islet there remained only a narrow channel which would
      doubtless be easy to cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact about ten o’clock Gideon Spilett and his two companions took off
      their clothing, placed them in bundles over their heads and ventured into
      the channel whose depth was not more than five feet. Herbert, for whom
      the water was too high, swam like a fish and managed wonderfully. All
      arrived without difficulty on the other side. There the sun rapidly dried
      them, they put on their clothes which they had preserved from contact
      with the water, and they discussed the next step.
