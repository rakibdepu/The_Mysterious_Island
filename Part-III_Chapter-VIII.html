      <b class="cap">Thus,</b> the convicts were still there, spying on the
      corral, and intent on killing the colonists one by one! There was nothing
      to do but treat them like wild beasts. But many precautions must be taken
      because these wretches had, at the moment, the advantage of the
      situation, being able to see yet not being seen, able to surprise by
      sudden attack yet not subject to surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith made arrangements for living at the corral where the
      provisions would suffice for a rather long time. Ayrton’s house had been
      provided with all that was necessary for life and the convicts,
      frightened by the arrival of the colonists, had not had time to pillage
      it. It was probable, as the reporter noted, that things had happened as
      follows: The six convicts, landing on the island, had followed the
      southern shore and after having doubled Serpentine Peninsula and not in
      the humor to venture into the woods of the Far West, they reached the
      mouth of Falls River. Once at this point, they ascended the right bank of
      the watercourse and arrived at the buttresses of Mount Franklin. It was
      natural that they would search for some retreat there, and they were not
      long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited. There they dug in,
      waiting for the moment to put their abominable plans into execution.
      Ayrton’s arrival surprised them but they had succeeded in overcoming the
      unlucky fellow and... the rest can be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the convicts—reduced to five it is true, but well armed—roamed the
      woods and to venture there would be to expose themselves to their fire,
      which they could do nothing to stop nor prevent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us wait! There is nothing else we can do,” repeated Cyrus Smith.
      “When Herbert will have recovered, we will be able to scour the island
      and get the better of these convicts. That will be the object of our
      grand expedition, while at the same time...”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will search it for our mysterious protector,” added Gideon Spilett,
      finishing the engineer’s sentence. “Ah, it must be admitted, my dear
      Cyrus, that this time his protection is in default at the very moment
      when we are most in need of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who knows!” replied the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What are you trying to say?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That we are not at the end of our troubles, my dear Spilett, and that
      his powerful intervention will perhaps still have occasion to exercise
      itself. But it has not acted now. Herbert’s life before anything else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the colonists’ most painful preoccupation. Several days passed
      and the poor lad’s condition had fortunately not grown worse. Now this
      was gaining much over the illness. The cold water, which was always
      maintained at a suitable temperature, had absolutely prevented the
      inflammation of the wounds. It even seemed to the reporter that this
      water, which was a little sulphurous—this was explained by the vicinity
      of the volcano—had a most direct action on the cicatrization. The pus was
      much less abundant and thanks to the incessant care with which he was
      surrounded, Herbert came back to life and his fever tended to diminish.
      He was, besides, under a severe diet and consequently his weakness was
      and had to be extreme; but there was no lack of healthful beverages and
      absolute rest did him a world of good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith, Gideon Spilett and Pencroff became very proficient at
      dressing the young invalid. All the linen in the dwelling had been
      sacrificed. Herbert’s wounds were covered again with compresses and
      linen, neither too tight nor too loose, so as to allow their
      cicatrization without bringing on an inflammatory reaction. The reporter
      applied these dressings with extreme care knowing full well that it was
      important and he repeated to his companions what the majority of
      physicians willingly recognize: that it is perhaps rarer to see a
      dressing well done than an operation well done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of ten days, the 22nd of November, Herbert was definitely
      improving. He began to take some nourishment. The color returned to his
      cheeks and he smiled at his nurses. He chatted a little in spite of
      Pencroff’s efforts to speak to him all the time with the most unlikely
      tales to prevent him from speaking. Herbert questioned him on the subject
      of Ayrton. He was astonished not to see him near him, thinking that he
      must be at the corral, but the sailor, not wanting to distress Herbert,
      was content to reply that Ayrton had rejoined Neb in order to defend
      Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hey!” he said, “these pirates! Here are gentlemen who have no right to
      any consideration. And Mister Smith wanted to pay them his compliments! I
      will send them compliments myself with bullets from a gun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And have they been seen again?” asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, my child,” replied the sailor, “but we will find them again, and
      when you will recover we will see if these cowards who shoot in the back
      will dare to attack us face to face.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am still weak, my poor Pencroff.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <div align="center">
        <img src="images/697.jpg" border="1" width="325" height="460" alt=

        <b>“I am still weak, my poor Pencroff.”</b>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      “Well! Your strength will come back little by little. What is a bullet
      through the chest? A simple joke. I have seen many others and I am not
      impressed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything seemed to be for the best and if no complication intervened,
      Herbert’s recovery could be regarded as assured. But what would have been
      the colonists’ situation if his condition had been aggravated, if for
      example, the bullet had remained in the body or if his arms or his legs
      had to be amputated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” Gideon Spilett said once more, “I have never thought of such an
      eventuality without shuddering.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet, if it had been necessary to do it,” Cyrus Smith asked him one
      day, “would you not have hesitated?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Cyrus!” said Gideon Spilett, “but thank God we were spared this
      complication.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As in many other such circumstances, the colonists had appealed to the
      logic of simple common sense which served them much of the time and once
      again, thanks to their general knowledge, they had succeeded. But would
      there come a time when all their science would be of no avail? They were
      alone on this island. Now men complement each other in society. They need
      each other. Cyrus Smith knew this well and several times he asked himself
      if some circumstance would arise which they would be powerless to
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, it seemed to him that his companions and he, who were so
      fortunate until now, were entering an unlucky period. Since the more than
      two and a half years that they had escaped from Richmond, they could say
      that everything had gone their way. The island had furnished them
      abundantly with minerals, vegetables and animals, and if nature had been
      constantly generous to them, their science had known how to do its share
      with what was offered to them. The material well being of the colony was
      complete, so to say. Then again, in certain circumstances an unexplained
      influence had come to their aid... But all that could only be for a time!
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Cyrus Smith thought that luck was turning against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the convicts’ vessel had appeared in the waters of the island
      and if these pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six
      of them at least had escaped the catastrophe. They had landed on the
      island and the five who survived were very nearly unassailable. Ayrton
      doubtless had been massacred by these wretches who possessed firearms and
      at the first use that they had made of it, Herbert fell almost mortally
      wounded. Were these then the first strokes of a contrary fortune directed
      against the colonists? That is what Cyrus Smith asked himself. That is
      what he often repeated to the reporter and it seemed to them that this
      strange but effective intervention which had served them until now, was
      now in default. Had this mysterious being, whoever he was, whose
      existence they could not deny, had he then abandoned the island? Had he
      succumbed in his turn?
    </p>
    <p>
      No response was possible to these questions. But we must not imagine that
      because Cyrus Smith and his companion spoke of these things that they
      were men to despair. Far from that. They looked the situation in the
      face, they analyzed their chances, they prepared themselves for any
      eventuality, they stood firm and straight before the future and if
      adversity should finally strike them, it would find men prepared to
      combat it.
