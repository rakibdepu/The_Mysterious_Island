      <b class="cap">The</b> next morning, the 8th of January, after a day and
      a night passed at the corral, all things being in order, Cyrus Smith and
      Ayrton returned to Granite House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer assembled his companions at once and told them that Lincoln
      Island was subject to an immense danger that no human power could avert.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friends,” he said—and his voice revealed a deep emotion—, “Lincoln
      Island is not one of those that will endure as long as the globe itself.
      It is destined in the near future to a destruction the cause of which is
      in itself and nothing can avoid it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists looked at each other and at the engineer. They did not
      understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Explain yourself, Cyrus,” said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will explain myself,” replied Cyrus Smith, “or rather I will only
      transmit to you the explanation which Captain Nemo gave me during the few
      minutes of our secret talk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Captain Nemo!” shouted the colonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and it is the last service which he wished to render us before
      dying.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The last service!” shouted Pencroff. “The last service! You will see
      that although he is dead he will render us still others!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what did Captain Nemo say to you?” asked the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Know it then, my friends,” replied the engineer. “Lincoln Island is not
      like other islands of the Pacific and a particular condition which
      Captain Nemo made known to me must sooner or later bring on a destruction
      of its submarine framework.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Destruction! Lincoln Island! Come now!” shouted Pencroff who, in spite
      of all the respect he had for Cyrus Smith, could not refrain from
      shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Listen to me, Pencroff,” continued the engineer. “This is what Captain
      Nemo said and what I confirmed myself during the exploration which I made
      in Dakkar Crypt yesterday. This crypt extends under the island as far as
      the volcano and it is separated from the central chimney by the wall at
      its end. Now this wall is covered with fractures and fizzures which
      already allow the passage of sulphurous gases from the interior of the
      volcano.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so?” asked Pencroff, whose forehead wrinkled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so I recognized that these fractures were growing larger under the
      interior pressure, that the basalt wall was cracking little by little and
      that in a more or less short time it would allow a passage for the sea
      water which fills the cavern.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good!” replied Pencroff, who once more was still trying to make a joke.
      “The sea will extinguish the volcano and everything will be finished!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, everything will be finished,” replied Cyrus Smith. “On the day when
      the sea rushes through the wall and penetrates through the central
      chimney into the bowels of the island where the eruptive materials are
      boiling, on that day, Pencroff, Lincoln Island will explode like Sicily
      would explode if the Mediterranean came rushing into Etna!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists did not reply to this affirmative statement from the
      engineer. They understood the danger that menaced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be said besides, that Cyrus Smith did not exaggerate in any way.
      Many people have the idea that one can perhaps extinguish volcanos which
      are nearly all located at the borders of a sea or a lake by opening a
      passage for their water. But they do not realize that this would run the
      risk of blowing up a part of the globe like a boiler which is suddenly
      subjected to overheating. The water, rushing into a confined region whose
      temperature is perhaps measured in thousands of degrees, would vaporize
      with such sudden energy that no casing could contain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus there was no doubt that the island, threatened by a frightful and
      forthcoming destruction, would endure only as long as the wall of Dakkar
      Crypt would itself endure. It was not even a question of months nor even
      of weeks but a question of days, of hours perhaps!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sentiment of the colonists was one of deep sorrow! They thought
      not of the peril which directly threatened them but of the destruction of
      this land which had given them asylum, this island which they had
      fertilized, this island which they loved, which they wanted to render so
      flourishing one day! So much effort uselessly dispensed, so much work
      lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff could not hold back a large tear which glistened on his cheek
      and which he did not try to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation continued for a little while longer. The chances to
      which the colonists could still count on were discussed but they
      concluded that there was not an hour to lose, that the construction and
      layout of the vessel must be pursued prodigiously and that this was now
      the only chance of safety for the inhabitants of Lincoln Island!
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands thus were needed. Of what use was it to reap, harvest, hunt, or
      increase the reserves of Granite House? What was still in the storeroom
      and the pantry would suffice, and even to provision the vessel for a
      trip, however long it might be! They had what they needed until such time
      as the inevitable catastrophe would occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was resumed at a feverish pace. Around the 23rd of January the
      vessel was half sided. Until then there had been no change at the top of
      the volcano. It was always vapor and smoke mixed with flames and
      incandescent stones which escaped from the crater. But during the night
      of the 23rd to the 24th, under the pressure of the lava which reached the
      level of the first stage of the volcano, the cone which formed the cap
      was blown off. A frightful noise was heard. At first the colonists
      thought that the island had cracked apart. They rushed outside Granite
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about two o’clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was on fire. The upper cone—a mass a thousand feet in height
      weighing millions of pounds—had fallen on the island making the ground
      tremble. Fortunately the cone inclined northward and it fell on the plain
      of sand and tuffs which extended between the volcano and the sea. The
      crater, now largely open, projected an intense light toward the sky which
      by the simple effect of reverberation seemed to make the atmosphere
      incandescent. At the same time, a torrent of lava swelled up at the new
      summit and poured out in long cascades like water which escapes from an
      overfull vase. A thousand serpents of fire crawled over the slope of the
      volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The corral! The corral!” shouted Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in fact toward the corral that the lava was flowing as a result of
      the orientation of the new crater and consequently it was the fertile
      parts of the island, the sources of Red Creek and Jacamar Woods which
      were threatened with immediate destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Ayrton’s cry, the colonists rushed toward the onagers’ stable. The
      cart was harnessed. All had but one thought, to rush to the corral and
      set the animals which it enclosed at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before three o’clock in the morning they arrived at the corral. The
      frightful howlings of the sheep and the goats indicated their terror.
      Already a torrent of incandescent material and liquified minerals fell
      from the buttresses on to the prairie and sapped away at this side of the
      palisade. The door was abruptly opened by Ayrton and the maddened animals
      escaped in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hour later the boiling lava filled the corral, vaporizing the water
      from the small brook which crossed it, setting fire to the house which
      burned like coal dust and devouring the palisaded enclosure to the last
      post. Nothing remained of the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists wanted to battle against this invasion. They would have
      done so madly and uselessly because man is helpless in the presence of
      great disasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day came on—the 24th of January. Cyrus Smith and his companions, before
      returning to Granite House, wanted to observe the definite direction
      which the deluge of lava would take. The general slope of the ground went
      downhill from Mount Franklin to the east coast and they feared that in
      spite of the thick Jacamar Woods, the torrent would reach Grand View
      Plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The lake will protect us,” said Gideon Spilett.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope so!” replied Cyrus Smith and that was his only response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists would have wanted to advance up to the plain on which the
      upper cone from Mount Franklin had fallen but the lava now barred the
      way. It followed Red Creek valley on the one hand and Falls River valley
      on the other, vaporizing these two watercourses by its passage. There was
      no possibility of crossing this torrent. On the contrary, they had to
      withdraw in front of it. The uncapped volcano was no longer recognizable.
      A sort of smooth table terminated it and replaced the former crater. Lava
      was pouring out incessantly from two cracks in the south and east rims,
      thus forming two distinct currents. Above the new crater, a cloud of
      smoke and cinders was mixed with some vapors of the atmosphere massed
      over the island. Thunder burst forth mingled with the rumblings from the
      mountain. Igneous rocks escaped from its mouth. They were thrown more
      that a thousand feet, bursting in the sky and dispersing like grapeshot.
      The sky replied to the volcanic eruption with flashes of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around seven o’clock in the morning, the position was no longer tenable
      for the colonists who had taken refuge at the edge of Jacamar Woods. Not
      only did projectiles begin to rain around them but lava, overflowing the
      bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the corral road. The first rows
      of trees caught fire and their sap, suddenly transformed to vapor, burst
      like firecrackers, while other less humid ones remained intact in the
      midst of the flooding.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/846.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>The position was no longer tenable...</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      The colonists moved back on the corral road. They walked slowly,
      retreating so to speak. But because of the inclination of the ground, the
      torrent gained rapidly in the east, and as soon as lower layers of lava
      became hard, other bubbling layers covered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the main current from the valley of Red Creek became more
      menacing. All of this part of the forest caught fire and enormous curls
      of smoke twirled above the trees whose crackling feet were already in the
      lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists stopped near the lake, a half mile from the mouth of Red
      Creek. A question of life and death was now to be decided by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyrus Smith, accustomed to deal with serious situations, and knowing that
      he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth whatever it might be,
      then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Either the lake will stop the flow and a part of the island will be
      preserved from complete devastation or the flow will invade the forests
      of the Far West and not a tree, not a plant will remain on the surface.
      We will have nothing to look forward to on these bare rocks but death
      from an explosion of the island!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then,” shouted Pencroff, crossing his arms and stamping on the ground,
      “it is useless to work on the boat, is it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pencroff,” replied Cyrus Smith, “we must do our duty to the end!”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the torrent of lava, after blazing a trail through the
      fine trees that it was destroying, reached the edge of the lake. There
      was a certain elevation in the ground there which if it had been higher
      could perhaps suffice to contain the torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To work!” shouted Cyrus Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer’s idea was understood immediately. They must dam up this
      torrent so to speak, and compel it to overflow into the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists ran to the shipyard. They brought back shovels, pickaxes,
      axes and by means of earthworks and fallen trees they succeeded in a few
      hours in erecting a dam three feet high and several hundred feet in
      length. It seemed to them, when they were finished, that they had barely
      worked for a few minutes!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just in time. The liquified material reached the lower part of the
      earthwork almost immediately. The torrent swelled up like a flooded river
      trying to overflow, and it threatened to pass over this only obstacle
      which prevented it from invading all of the Far West... But the dam
      succeeded in containing it and after a terrible minute of hesitation it
      fell down twenty feet into Lake Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonists, out of breath, looked at this battle between the two
      elements without making a gesture and without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a spectacle was this combat between fire and water! What pen could
      describe this scene of marvellous horror, and what brush could paint it!
      The water hissed and evaporated on contact with the boiling lava. The
      vapors were thrown into the air, twirling to a great height as if the
      valves of an immense boiler had suddenly been opened. But as considerable
      as was the mass of water contained in the lake, it must in the end be
      absorbed because the torrent, fed by an inexhaustible source, kept
      flowing with new waves of incandescent material.
    </p>
    <pic>
      <img src="images/849.jpg" width="75%"></img>
      <b>What a spectacle was this combat between fire and water!</b>
    </pic>
    <p>
      The first lava which fell into the lake solidified immediately,
      accumulated and soon emerged. Other lava slid over its surface, becoming
      hard in its turn but gaining toward the center. A jetty of sorts formed
      and threatened to fill up the lake which did not overflow because the
      excess water evaporated. Hissings and cracklings rent the air with a
      deafening noise and the steam, caught up by the wind, fell back into the
      sea as rain. The jetty became longer and blocks of solidified lava piled
      up on each other. Where formerly there had been peaceful water, there now
      appeared an enormous pileup of smoking rocks as if an uprising of the
      ground had make a thousand reefs appear. If one could imagine the water
      agitated during a storm, then suddenly solidified by a twenty degree
      frost, he would have a picture of the lake three hours after the
      irresistible torrent had erupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time water would be vanquished by fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the
      discharge of the lava had been directly toward Lake Grant. They had
      before them several days of respite. Grand View Plateau, Granite House
      and the construction yard were preserved for the moment. Now these few
      days must be used to plank the vessel and to caulk it carefully. Then
      they would launch it and take refuge on it, leaving the rigging for when
      it was in its element. With the fear of the explosion which threatened to
      destroy the island, there was no longer any security in remaining on
      land. The Granite House retreat, formerly so secure, could become blocked
      up within its granite walls at any moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the six days which followed, from the 25th to the 30th of January,
      the colonists did as much work on the vessel as twenty men could have
      done. Hardly taking any rest, the glare from the flames which rushed out
      from the crater allowed them to continue day and night. The volcano was
      always overflowing but perhaps with less abundance. This was fortunate
      because Lake Grant was almost entirely filled and if new lava would have
      piled up over the surface of the old, it would inevitably spill on to
      Grand View Plateau and from there on to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this side of the island was partly protected, it was not so with
      the western portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the second current of lava which had followed the large valley
      of Falls River whose terrain was depressed on each side of the creek, had
      found no obstacle. The incandescent liquid therefore flowed across the
      forests of the Far West. At this time of the year, when the trees were
      dry from the torrid heat, the forest caught fire instantly, with the fire
      propagating simultaneously at the base of the trunks and by the high
      branches whose interlacing aided the progress of the conflagration. It
      even seemed that the current of flame at the top of the trees moved
      faster than the current of lava below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maddened animals, jaguars, boars, capybaras, koalas, game of ground
      and sky, took refuge on the banks of the Mercy and in the Tadorn marsh
      beyond the road to Port Balloon. But the colonists were too preoccupied
      with their work to pay any attention to even the most formidable of these
      animals. Besides, they had abandoned Granite House. They had not even
      wanted to find shelter in the Chimneys and they camped under a tent near
      the mouth of the Mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day Cyrus Smith and Gideon Spilett ascended to Grand View Plateau.
      Sometimes Herbert accompanied them but never Pencroff who did not wish to
      see the profoundly devastated island under its new aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact it was a distressing spectacle. All the wooded part of the island
      was now bare. A single cluster of green trees stood at the extremity of
      Serpentine Peninsula. Here and there several branchless blackened stumps
      grimaced. The land on which the destroyed forests were located was more
      barren than the Tadorn marsh. The enroachment of lava was complete. Where
      formerly wonderful foliage grew, the ground was now only a savage pile of
      volcanic tuffs. The valleys of Falls River and of the Mercy did not spill
      a single drop of water into the sea and the colonists would not have had
      any means of appeasing their thirst if Lake Grant had been completely
      dry. But fortunately its southern corner had been spared and formed a
      sort of pond containing all that remained of the potable water on the
      island. Toward the northwest, the grim and rugged outlines of the
      buttresses of the volcano looked like gigantic claws grasping the ground.
      What a sorrowful spectacle, what an appalling sight, and what regrets for
      these colonists who, from a fertile domain covered with forests,
      irrigated by watercourses, enriched by crops, to find themselves in an
      instant transported to a devastated rock on which, without their
      reserves, they would not even have been able to live!
    </p>
    <p>
      “It breaks my heart,” Gideon Spilett said one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Spilett,” replied the engineer. “May Heaven give us time to finish
      this boat, now our only refuge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you not find, Cyrus, that the volcano seems to be getting calmer? It
      is still vomiting lava, but less abundantly, if I am not mistaken!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s of little importance,” replied Cyrus Smith. “The fire is always
      burning in the bowels of the mountain and the sea can rush in at any
      moment. We are in the position of passengers whose vessel is being
      devoured by a fire that they cannot extinguish and who know that sooner
      or later it will reach the powder room! Come Spilett, come and let us not
      lose an hour!”
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next eight days, that is to say until the 7th of February, the
      lava continued to pour out but the eruption kept within the indicated
      limits. Cyrus Smith feared above all else that the liquified material
      would overflow on the beach and in that case the shipyard would not be
      spared. However, about this time, the colonists felt vibrations in the
      framework of the island which made them uneasy to the highest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 20th of February. There was still a month before the vessel
      was fit to go to sea. Would the island hold up until then? Pencroff’s and
      Cyrus Smith’s intention was to proceed with the launching of the vessel
      as soon as the hull was sufficiently watertight. The bridge, the
      superstructure, the interior arrangements and the rigging would be done
      later, but the important thing was that the colonists would have a secure
      refuge off the island. Perhaps it would be better to take the vessel to
      Port Balloon, that is to say as far as possible from the eruptive center,
      because at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and the granite
      wall, it ran the risk of being crushed in case of the island’s breakup.
      All the efforts of the workers were therefore directed toward finishing
      the hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the 3rd of March and they could plan that the launching
      would take place in about a dozen days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope returned to the colonists, so stricken with misfortune during this
      fourth year of their stay on Lincoln Island! Pencroff himself seemed to
      come a little out of this gloomy taciturnity into which the ruin and
      devastation of his domain had plunged him. He thought of nothing truly
      but of this vessel on which he concentrated all his hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We will finish it!” he said to the engineer. “We will finish it, Mister
      Cyrus, and it will be just in time because the season is advanced and we
      will soon be at the height of the equinox. Oh well, if need be we will
      put in at Tabor Island and pass the winter there! But Tabor Island after
      Lincoln Island! Ah! Woe of my life! Did I ever believe that I would see
      such a thing!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us hurry!” the engineer would inevitably reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they worked on without losing a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My master,” asked Neb a few days later. “If Captain Nemo had still been
      alive, do you think that all this would have happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, Neb,” replied Cyrus Smith.

      “Oh well, as for me, I do not believe it!” murmured Pencroff in Neb’s
      ear.

      “Nor I,” replied Neb seriously.

      During the first week of March, Mount Franklin again became threatening.
      Thousands of glass threads, made of liquid lava, fell on the ground like
      rain. The crater again filled with lava which poured out on all sides of
      the volcano. The torrent ran over the surface of the hardened tuffs and
      ended by destroying the straggling skeletons of trees which had withstood
      the first eruption. The flow, following this time the southwest bank of
      Lake Grant, carried as far as Glycerin Creek and overran Grand View
      Plateau. This last stroke, affecting the accomplishments of the
      colonists, was terrible. The windmill, the houses of the poultry yard,
      the stables, nothing remained of them. The frightened birds disappeared
      in all directions. Top and Jup gave signs of the greatest fright and
      their instinct forewarned them that a catastrophe was near. A good number
      of the animals had perished during the first eruption. Those that had
      survived found refuge at the Tadorn marsh, except for the few to whom
      Grand View Plateau offered asylum. But this last retreat was finally
      closed to them and the river of lava, overflowing the edge of the granite
      wall, began to rain its cataracts of fire on the beach. The sublime
      horror of this spectacle escapes all description. During the night it was
      like a Niagara of molten liquid with its incandescent vapors above and
      its bubbling masses below!

      The colonists were forced into their last entrenchment and even though
      the upper seams of the vessel still had not been caulked, they resolved
      to launch it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pencroff and Ayrton proceeded then with the preparations for the
      launching which was to have taken place the next day on the morning of
      the 9th of March.

      But during the night of the 8th to the 9th an enormous column of vapor,
      escaping from the crater, rose to a height of more than three thousand
      feet amidst frightful detonations. The wall of Dakkar cavern had
      evidently given way under the pressure of the gas, and the sea, rushing
      into the fire-emitting abyss by way of the central chimney, suddenly
      vaporized. But the crater could not give a sufficient outlet for these
      vapors. An explosion, which was heard a hundred miles away, shook the
      air. Pieces of mountain fell back into the sea and in a few minutes the
      ocean covered the place where Lincoln Island had been.
