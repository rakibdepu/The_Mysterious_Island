<p class="huge">
    <b class="cap">In</b> a few words Gideon Spilett, Herbert and Neb were
    brought up to date. This accident which could have very serious
    consequences—at least Pencroff envisioned it so—produced diverse effects
    on the honest sailor’s companions.
</p>
<p>
    Neb, in his joy at having found his master, did not listen, or rather did
    not even want to concern himself with what Pencroff said. Herbert, to
    some degree, shared the sailor’s apprehensions.
</p>
<p>
    As to the reporter he simply responded to Pencroff’s words:
</p>
<p>
    “By my faith, Pencroff, it’s all the same to me!”
</p>
<p>
    “But I repeat to you that we no longer have any fire!”
</p>
<p>
    “Pooh!”
</p>
<p>
    “Nor any means of relighting it.”
</p>
<p>
    “Fudge!”
</p>
<p>
    “Nevertheless, Mister Spilett...”
</p>
<p>
    “Isn’t Cyrus Smith here?” replied the reporter. “Isn’t our engineer
    alive? He will easily find the means of making us some fire, he!”
</p>
<p>
    “And with what?”
</p>
<p>
    “With nothing.”
</p>
<p>
    What could Pencroff say? There was no reply because deep down he shared
    the confidence that his companions had in Cyrus Smith. The engineer was
    for them a microcosm composed of all the science and all human
    intelligence. Better to find oneself with Cyrus on a deserted island than
    without Cyrus in the most industrialized city of the Union. With him they
    could want for nothing. With him they could not despair. If someone were
    to tell these brave people that a volcanic eruption would annihilate this
    land, that this land would be thrown into the depths of the Pacific, they
    would have imperturbably replied: “Cyrus is here. See Cyrus!”
</p>
<p>
    In the meanwhile, however, the engineer was once more plunged into a new
    prostration brought on by the journey and they could not call on his
    ingenuity at the moment. Supper was necessarily meager. In fact all the
    grouse meat had been eaten and there was no means whatsoever of roasting
    any game. Besides, the couroucous which served as a reserve had
    disappeared. Thus they must consider. Before anything else Cyrus Smith
    was transported into the central corridor. There they managed to arrange
    a couch of algae and seaweed that had remained almost dry. The deep sleep
    that took possession of him would doubtless do more to quickly bring his
    strength back than would any abundant nourishment.
</p>
<p>
    Night came on and with it the temperature, modified by a shift in the
    wind from the northeast, went to freezing once more. Now, since the sea
    had destroyed the partitions established by Pencroff at certain points in
    the corridors, the air currents were re-established, which rendered the
    Chimneys barely habitable. The engineer would therefore have found
    himself in rather poor circumstances if his companions, removing a vest
    or a waistcoat, had not carefully covered him.
</p>
<p>
    Supper this evening was composed only of the inevitable lithodomes amply
    gathered by Herbert and Neb on the shore. However, to these mollusks the
    lad added a certain quantity of edible algae that he collected on some
    high rocks that the sea could not reach except at times of extremely high
    tides. These algae belonged to the fucus family, being a species of
    sargassum which when dry furnishes a gelatinous material rather rich in
    nutrients. The reporter and his companions, after having eaten a
    considerable quantity of lithodomes, sucked this sargassum which they
    found to have a good flavor. It should be said that on Asiatic shores
    they are an important food for the natives.
</p>
<p>
    “Never mind,” said the sailor, “it is time for Mister Smith to help us.”
</p>
<p>
    However, the cold became very sharp and unfortunately they had no means
    of fighting it.
</p>
<p>
    The sailor, truly vexed, looked for every possible way to make a fire.
    Neb even helped him with this. They found some dry moss and striking two
    pebbles they obtained some sparks but the moss, not being sufficiently
    flammable, did not catch. Moreover, these sparks, which were only from
    incandescent flint, did not have the same consistency as those which
    escape from a piece of steel in the ordinary tinder box. Thus the
    operation did not succeed.
</p>
<p>
    Pencroff, while having no confidence in the procedure, then tried rubbing
    two pieces of dry wood against each other the way the savages do.
    Certainly the work put in by Neb and himself, if transformed into heat
    according to the latest theories, would have been sufficient to heat the
    boiler of a steamer. The result was negative. The wood heated up, that
    was all, but not as much as the operators themselves.
</p>
<pic>
    <img alt="Pencroff tried rubbing two pieces..." src="images/103.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Pencroff tried rubbing two pieces...</p>
</pic>
<p>
    After working for an hour Pencroff was in a rage and he threw the pieces
    of wood away with spite.
</p>
<p>
    “When someone can make me believe that the savages make fire in this way”
    he said, “it will be hot even in winter! I could sooner light up my arms
    by rubbing them against each other!”
</p>
<p>
    The sailor was wrong in belittling this procedure. It is known that
    savages set fire to wood by means of a rapid rubbing. But all kinds of
    wood are not proper for this operation and in addition there is the
    “knack”, following the hallowed expression, and it is likely that
    Pencroff did not have the “knack.”
</p>
<p>
    Pencroff’s ill humor did not last long. The two pieces of wood thrown
    away by him were retrieved by Herbert who did his best to rub them with
    renewed vigor. The robust sailor could not hold back a laugh on seeing
    the adolescent’s efforts to succeed where he had failed.
</p>
<p>
    “Rub, my boy, rub!” he said.
</p>
<p>
    “I am rubbing,” replied Herbert laughing, “but I do not pretend to do
    anything except take my turn at warming myself instead of shivering. Soon
    I will be as warm as you, Pencroff!”
</p>
<p>
    That is what happened. But he had to give up on making a fire for this
    evening. Gideon Spilett repeated for the twentieth time that Cyrus Smith
    would not have been inconvenienced by such a trifle. And while waiting,
    he stretched out in one of the corridors on a bed of sand. Herbert, Neb
    and Pencroff did likewise while Top slept at the foot of his master.
</p>
<p>
    The next day, March 28th, when the engineer woke up about eight o’clock
    in the morning he saw his companions near him watching his sleep. As on
    the previous day his first words were:
</p>
<p>
    “Island or continent?”
</p>
<p>
    One could see that he had but one idea.
</p>
<p>
    “Well” replied Pencroff, “we know nothing about it, Mister Smith!”
</p>
<p>
    “You still do not know?...”
</p>
<p>
    “But we will know,” added Pencroff, “when you will have guided us in this
    land.”
</p>
<p>
    “I think I’m well enough to try it,” replied the engineer who, without
    too much effort, got up and held himself erect.
</p>
<p>
    “That’s good,” cried the sailor.
</p>
<p>
    “I am dying especially of exhaustion,” replied Cyrus Smith. “My friends,
    a little nourishment, and it will no longer show. You have some fire,
    don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
    This question did not get an immediate response. But after a few moments:
</p>
<p>
    “Alas! We have no fire,” said Pencroff, “or rather, Mister Cyrus, we have
    it no longer!”
</p>
<p>
    And the sailor related all that had occurred on the previous day. He
    enlivened the engineer with his story of the single match and of his
    aborted attempt to make a fire the way the savages do.
</p>
<p>
    “We will think about it,” replied the engineer, “and if we do not find a
    substance similar to tinder...”
</p>
<p>
    “Then?” asked the sailor.
</p>
<p>
    “Then we will make matches.”
</p>
<p>
    “With chemicals?”
</p>
<p>
    “With chemicals.”
</p>
<p>
    “It isn’t more difficult than that,” cried the reporter, slapping the
    sailor’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    The latter did not find the thing so simple but he did not protest. They
    all went out. The weather was fine once again. A bright sun was rising on
    the sea’s horizon, striking the rugged prisms of the enormous wall with
    golden rays.
</p>
<p>
    After having cast a quick glance around him the engineer sat down on a
    rock. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of mussels and seaweed saying:
</p>
<p>
    “This is all that we have, Mister Cyrus.”
</p>
<p>
    “Thanks, my boy,” replied Cyrus Smith, “this will suffice, for this
    morning at least.”
</p>
<p>
    And he ate with appetite this meager nourishment which he washed down
    with a little fresh water drawn from the river in a large shell.
</p>
<p>
    His companions looked at him without speaking. Then after satisfying
    himself more or less, Cyrus Smith crossed his arms saying:
</p>
<p>
    “So my friends, you still do not know if fate has thrown us on a
    continent or on an island?”
</p>
<p>
    “No, Mister Cyrus,” responded the lad.
</p>
<p>
    “We will know that tomorrow,” replied the engineer. “Until then, there is
    nothing to do.”
</p>
<p>
    “Except,” said Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    “What?”
</p>
<p>
    “Fire” said the sailor, who also had only one idea.
</p>
<p>
    “We will make it, Pencroff,” replied Cyrus Smith. “While you transported
    me yesterday didn’t I see in the west a mountain which overlooked this
    land?”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett, “a rather high mountain...”
</p>
<p>
    “Good,” replied the engineer, “tomorrow we will climb to the top and we
    will see if this land is an island or a continent. Until then, I repeat,
    there is nothing to do.”
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, some fire,” said the stubborn sailor.
</p>
<p>
    “But we will make fire,” replied Gideon Spilett, “a little patience,
    Pencroff.”
</p>
<p>
    The sailor looked at Gideon Spilett as if to say: “If it depended on you
    to make it, we wouldn’t taste any roast soon.” But he was silent.
</p>
<p>
    However, Cyrus Smith did not reply. He seemed very little preoccupied
    with this question of fire. For several moments he remained absorbed in
    his thoughts. Then he spoke again.
</p>
<p>
    “My friends,” he said, “our situation is perhaps deplorable but in any
    case it is very simple. Either we are on a continent and then at the
    price of more or less fatigue we will reach some inhabited point or we
    are definitely on an island. In the latter case there are two
    possibilities: If the island is inhabited we will see to our affairs with
    its inhabitants: If it is deserted, we will see to our affairs all
    alone.”
</p>
<p>
    “Nothing is simpler,” replied Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    “But be it a continent or an island,” asked Gideon Spilett, “where do you
    think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?”
</p>
<p>
    “The exact location I cannot determine,” replied the engineer, “but the
    indications are for a land in the Pacific. In fact when we left Richmond
    the wind blew from the northeast and its violence even proves that its
    direction should not have varied. If this direction was maintained from
    northeast to southwest we crossed the states of North Carolina, South
    Carolina, Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico itself in its narrow part,
    then a portion of the Pacific Ocean. I estimate that the distance covered
    by the balloon was not less than six to seven thousand miles. If the wind
    varied by as little as an eighth it would have carried us either to the
    archipelago of Marquesas or to the Tuamotu, and if it had a much larger
    speed than I suppose, even to New Zealand. If this latter hypothesis is
    the case our return home will be easy. English or Maoris, we will always
    find someone to speak to. If, on the contrary, this shore is a part of
    some deserted island of a micronesian archipelago, perhaps we will
    recognize this from the top of the cone which overlooks this land, then
    we will plan on establishing ourselves here as if we will never leave
    it!”
</p>
<p>
    “Never,” cried the reporter. “You say never, my dear Cyrus.”
</p>
<p>
    “Better to first put things in the worst,” replied the engineer, “and
    save the surprise for the better.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well spoken,” said Pencroff, “and it is also to be hoped that this
    island, if it is one, will not be exactly situated outside the ship
    lanes. That would really be a run of bad luck.”
</p>
<p>
    “We will know what we have to contend with after we have first climbed
    the mountain,” replied the engineer.
</p>
<p>
    “But tomorrow, Mister Cyrus,” asked Herbert, “will you be strong enough
    to make this climb?”
</p>
<p>
    “I hope so,” responded the engineer, “but on the condition that Master
    Pencroff and you, my boy, show yourselves to be intelligent and skillful
    hunters.”
</p>
<p>
    “Mister Cyrus,” replied the sailor, “since you are speaking of game, if,
    on my return, I was as certain of being able to roast it as I am of
    bringing it back...”
</p>
<p>
    “Bring it back all the same, Pencroff,” responded Cyrus Smith.
</p>
<p>
    It was thus agreed that the engineer and the reporter would spend the day
    at the Chimneys in order to examine the shore and the upper plateau.
    During this time Neb, Herbert and the sailor would return to the forest,
    there to renew the stockpile of wood and to lay hands on all beasts with
    feathers or hair that would come within their reach.
</p>
<p>
    They then left about ten o’clock in the morning, Herbert confident, Neb
    joyful and Pencroff mumbling to himself:
</p>
<p>
    “If, on my return home I find fire, I’ll believe that thunder came in
    person to light it.”
</p>
<p>
    All three went up the bank and arrived at the bend formed by the river.
    The sailor stopped and said to his companions:
</p>
<p>
    “Shall we begin by being hunters or woodsmen?”
</p>
<p>
    “Hunters,” responded Herbert. “Top is already on the hunt.”
</p>
<p>
    “Hunters then,” replied the sailor. “Then we will return here to renew
    our stockpile of wood.”
</p>
<p>
    That said, Herbert, Neb and Pencroff, after having torn off three sticks
    from the trunk of a young fir tree, followed Top who dashed in among the
    tall grass.
</p>
<p>
    This time the hunters, instead of walking along the rivercourse, plunged
    directly into the depths of the forest. It was always the same trees
    belonging for the most part to the pine family. In certain less crowded
    areas, isolated in clusters, these pines were very large and seemed to
    indicate by their development that this country was at a higher latitude
    than that conjectured by the engineer. Some clearings, bristling with
    stumps rotted by time, were covered with dead wood, and formed an
    inexhaustible reserve of fuel. Then, the clearing past, the brushwood
    grew closer and became almost impenetrable.
</p>
<p>
    Without a beaten path it was rather difficult to find their way among
    these massive trees. Thus from time to time the sailor marked out his
    route by breaking some boughs that would be easy to recognize. But
    perhaps they were wrong not to have followed the water’s course as
    Herbert and he had done during their first excursion because after an
    hour’s march they still had no game to show. Top, moving under low
    branches, only gave warning of birds they could not get near. The
    couroucous themselves were absolutely invisible and it was likely that
    the sailor would be forced to return to that marshy part of the forest in
    which he had so fortunately used his fishing line against the grouse.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, Pencroff,” said Neb in a slightly sarcastic tone of voice, “if
    this is all the game that you have promised to bring back to my master it
    will not take a big fire to roast it.”
</p>
<p>
    “Patience, Neb,” responded the sailor, “it will not be the game that will
    be missing upon our return.”
</p>
<p>
    “Have you no confidence in Mister Smith?”
</p>
<p>
    “Certainly.”
</p>
<p>
    “But you do not believe that he will make a fire?”
</p>
<p>
    “I will believe it when the wood is burning on the hearth.”
</p>
<p>
    “It will burn since my master has said so.”
</p>
<p>
    “We shall see.”
</p>
<p>
    However, the sun had not yet attained its highest point in its course
    above the horizon. The exploration therefore continued and was marked by
    a useful discovery, made by Herbert, of a tree whose fruit is edible. It
    was the pine kernel which produces an excellent almond, highly esteemed
    in the temperate regions of America and of Europe. These almonds were
    perfectly ripe and Herbert pointed this out to his two companions who
    were delighted by it.
</p>
<p>
    “Well,” said Pencroff, “we have algae to take the place of bread, mussels
    for meat, and almonds for desert, what a meal for people who don’t have a
    single match in their pocket.”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s no use complaining,” replied Herbert.
</p>
<p>
    “I do not complain, my boy” said Pencroff. “Only I repeat that meat is
    too much economized in this type of meal.”
</p>
<p>
    “Top has seen something!...” shouted Neb, who ran toward a thicket in
    which the dog had disappeared while barking. With Top’s barks were
    mingled some peculiar growls.
</p>
<p>
    The sailor and Herbert followed Neb. If they had some game here this was
    not the time to discuss how to cook it but how to capture it.
</p>
<p>
    The hunters had hardly entered the thicket when they saw Top holding an
    animal by an ear. This quadruped was a kind of pig about two and a half
    feet long, blackish brown but not as dark on the underside, having tough
    but thin hair. The animal’s toes, which were then gripping the ground,
    seemed to be united by membranes. Herbert thought he recognized this
    animal as a capybara, that is to say one of the largest rodents.
</p>
<pic>
    <img alt="The hunters saw Top holding..." src="images/112.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>The hunters saw Top holding...</p>
</pic>
<p>
    However, the capybara was not struggling with the dog. It stupidly rolled
    its large eyes which were deeply imbedded in a thick layer of fat.
    Perhaps it saw men for the first time.
</p>
<p>
    However Neb, holding his stick firmly in his hand, went to kill the
    rodent when the latter, being held only by the tip of his ear, tore
    himself away from Top’s teeth, gave a hearty grunt, plunged headlong on
    Herbert, threw him half over, and disappeared through the woods.
</p>
<p>
    “The rascal!” cried Pencroff.
</p>
<p>
    Immediately all three darted after Top and at the moment when they
    rejoined him, the animal disappeared under the waters of a large pond
    shaded by some large old pines.
</p>
<p>
    Neb, Herbert and Pencroff stopped, immobile. Top threw himself into the
    water but the capybara, lying at the bottom of the pond, was no longer
    visible.
</p>
<p>
    “Let us wait,” said the lad, “because he will soon come to the surface to
    breath.”
</p>
<p>
    “Won’t he drown?” asked Neb.
</p>
<p>
    “No,” replied Herbert, “since his feet are webbed and it is almost an
    amphibian. But watch for him.”
</p>
<p>
    Top continued to swim. Pencroff and his two companions each occupied a
    different point on the bank in order to cut off all retreat for the
    capybara which the dog was looking for while swimming on the surface of
    the pond.
</p>
<p>
    Herbert was not mistaken. After a few minutes the animal emerged above
    the waters. Top was after him in a bound and prevented him from plunging
    again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was killed by
    a blow from Neb’s stick.
</p>
<p>
    “Hurrah!” cried Pencroff, who gladly used this cry of triumph. “If we
    could only get a hot fire this rodent will be gnawed to the bone.”
</p>
<p>
    Pencroff loaded the capybara on his shoulder and judging by the height of
    the sun that it was about two o’clock, he gave the signal to return.
</p>
<p>
    Top’s instinct was not useless to the hunters who, thanks to the
    intelligent animal, were able to find the road already traveled on. A
    half hour later they arrived at the bend in the river.
</p>
<p>
    As he had done the first time, Pencroff quickly made a raft of wood, even
    though for want of a fire it seemed like a useless task, and with the
    raft moving downstream, they returned to the Chimneys.
</p>
<p>
    But the sailor had not gone fifty steps when he stopped, let out a new
    formidable hurrah, and pointing to the corner of the cliff:
</p>
<p>
    “Herbert! Neb! Look!” he shouted.
</p>
<pic>
    <img alt="“Herbert! Neb! Look!” shouted Pencroff." src="images/115.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>“Herbert! Neb! Look!” shouted Pencroff.</p>
</pic>
<p>
    Smoke was escaping and twirling above the rocks!
